Chairs: [Marcela Melara](https://github.com/marcelamelara), [Yesenia Yser](https://github.com/Cyber-JiuJiteria) and [Jay White](https://github.com/camaleon2016)

## **Overview**

The BEAR WG continues our mission to increase representation and strengthen the overall effectiveness of the cybersecurity workforce. The WG continues to see relatively low regular attendance in meetings (5 attendees on average), we are seeing increased engagement on Slack.

Over the past quarter, we've made progress in these areas:

* The WG reached [Incubating](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/wg-lifecycle-documents/WG_DEI_incubating_stage.md) stage.
* We've continued our monthly Community Office Hours focused on different underrepresented groups in OSS have been regularly attracting regular and new attendees.
* Our proposal for a panel discussion on mentoring at OSS NA '25 was not accepted.
* TAC approved our TI Funding Request for [LFX Mentorship Projects (summer cycle '25)](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/451) approving 5 mentorships with the RSTUF and gittuf projects (see [blog post](https://openssf.org/blog/2025/05/08/announcing-the-summer-2025-openssf-mentorship-program/)).
* The applications to the 5 paid summer mentorship are live in the LFX portal: [RSTUF](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/310e66d9-34db-41f6-8450-a29bf748a99b?__hstc=14087400.ac2164099db5960b619453ee8856e65c.1714423384506.1747066680319.1747073168804.36&__hssc=14087400.1.1747073168804&__hsfp=2877591942) and [gittuf](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/682e1c59-cd50-4602-ac91-2da8a9be01ea?__hstc=14087400.ac2164099db5960b619453ee8856e65c.1714423384506.1747066680319.1747073168804.36&__hssc=14087400.1.1747073168804&__hsfp=2877591942).

## **Community Office Hours**

### **Purpose**

Our Community Office Hours are a monthly event in which a panel of industry experts discuss a specific topic relevant to the WG's mission. Each month, we aim to host diverse speakers that represent different underrepresented groups, elevating different voices and connecting different communities.

### **Current Status**

Since February, our Community Office Hours have focused on giving a voice to various underrepresented groups in OSS and the cybersecurity industry, creating a space to for different members of our community to share their journey:

## **OpenSSF Mentorship Program**

### **Purpose**

A core goal of the OpenSSF BEAR WG is to empower newcomers and underrepresented individuals seeking opportunities in the cybersecurity workforce. Joining forces with the Linux Foundation (LFX) mentorship program, the BEAR WG has partnered with [RSTUF](https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf) and [gittuf](https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf) projects for the Summer 2025 OpenSSF Mentorship program.

### **Current Status**

* Applications went live on April 23rd and will run until May 19th.
* Announcement blog on the Summer Mentorships went out on May 8 with [social media highlight](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/openssf_cybersecurity-opensourcesecurity-rstuf-activity-7326337323963478018-9Yn0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACgrwvYBfQAAF4iBL1QswnqUr3pqBTxkunw).

* Onboarding of mentees will start May 27.
* Mentorship begins June 2 until August 22, with evaluations for mentee payment on July 3, Aug 1 and August 29.

## **Panel Discussions at Major Conferences**

### **Purpose**

Members of the OpenSSF BEAR WG community host panel discussions at major industry conferences to raise awareness about the WG and to engage with folks beyond the OpenSSF. A primary goal of the discussions is for panelists to share their experiences and advice for newcomers to the OSS and cybersecurity space.

### **Current Status**

Our panel discussion on mentoring was unfortunately not accepted at OSS NA
'25.

### **Up Next**

We are planning to submit our panel discussion on mentoring to an upcoming CFP. 
Submissions under discussion:

* KubeCon in Atlanta, GA Nov 2025
* Grace Hopper Open Source Day in Chicago, IL Nov 2025

## **Creating more spaces**

While we've gotten positive feedback about the current meetings the BEAR WG
hosts, we've gotten feedback about certain other spaces our community would like
to have available to them. In the coming months, we hope to begin hosting
OpenSSF Welcome Calls, BEAR Hour and establish more community-specific Slack
channels.

### **Welcome Calls**

Common feedback we receive from newcomers who join our WG meetings or Slack
channel is that the large number of OpenSSF TIs can be difficult to navigate and
find a good entry point into a project. OpenSSF Welcome Calls will give new
community members an overview of the ongoing OpenSSF initiatives and describe
ways to get involved. We are hoping to collaborate with the DevRel community
on this effort.

### **BEAR Hour**

We have also gotten feedback about the fact the recorded meetings can have a
chilling effect on members when discussing potentially sensitive topics related
to community-specific experiences and needs in OSS/cybersecurity. BEAR Hour is
our current idea for hosting unrecorded conversations via Zoom, but there are
several open questions around ensuring accessibilty, establishing a code of
conduct, and controlling for spammers/trolls.

### **Questions/Issues for the TAC**

We would greatly appreciate the TAC's input on hosting Welcome Calls and BEAR
Hours (or similar).
