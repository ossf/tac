## Securing Software Repositories Working Group

### Purpose

Improve security of software repositories by providing a forum for discussion, a maturity model for security roadmaps, and guidance for individual security capabilities. These conversations, roadmaps, and guidance help ecosystems learn from each other, which accelerates the deployment of security capabilities.

### Current Status

- [UI/UX support for attestations on software repos - phase 1 (recommendations) complete](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos/blob/main/docs/attestations-style-guide.md)
- [RSTUF had v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- [NuGet now supports Trusted Publishing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/trusted-publishing)

### Up Next

- Lots of continued attacks / mitigation discussions
  - Phishing maintainers for TOTP (should we move to phishing-resistant MFA?)
  - Quarantine / soft-delete as capabilities for dealing with increased malware submissions
  - Malware detection capabilities
