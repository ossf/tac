## Securing Software Repositories Working Group

### Purpose

Improve security of software repositories by providing a forum for discussion, a maturity model for security roadmaps, and guidance for individual security capabilities. These conversations, roadmaps, and guidance help ecosystems learn from each other, which accelerates the deployment of security capabilities.

### Current Status

- [Rust Crates now supports Trusted Publishing](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/07/11/crates-io-development-update-2025-07/)
- [npm now supports Trusted Publishing](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-31-npm-trusted-publishing-with-oidc-is-generally-available/)
- RSTUF participating in summer mentorship program

### Up Next

- Wrap up [UI/UX support for attestations on software repos](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/424)
- Support (at least) one more security capability landing
  - NuGet trusted publishing?
- RSTUF v1.0.0 release
- Check in on [Sigstore specifications for the conda ecosystem](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/472)
