## Reporting

We published our [annual report](https://alpha-omega.dev/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/01/Alpha-Omega-Annual-Report-2024_012925.pdf) and [impact/outcomes report](https://alpha-omega.dev/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/01/Alpha-Omega-GranteeReport-2024_012925.pdf) in January 2025. One change for this year is that we're moving to quarterly reports instead of [monthly](https://alpha-omega.dev/resources/reports/) -- our Q1 report will be out in the next few weeks.
