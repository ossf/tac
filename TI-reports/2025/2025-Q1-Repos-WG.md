## Securing Software Repositories Working Group

### Purpose

Improve security of software repositories by providing a forum for discussion, a maturity model for security roadmaps, and guidance for individual security capabilities. These conversations, roadmaps, and guidance help ecosystems learn from each other, which accelerates the deployment of security capabilities.

### Current Status
