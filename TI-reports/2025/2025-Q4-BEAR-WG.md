2025 Q4 BEAR WG
Chairs: [Marcela Melara](https://github.com/marcelamelara), [Yesenia Yser](https://github.com/Cyber-JiuJiteria) and [Jay White](https://github.com/camaleon2016)

**Overview**

The BEAR WG continues our mission to increase representation and strengthen the
overall effectiveness of the cybersecurity workforce. The WG continues to see
relatively low regular attendance in meetings (5 attendees on avg), we are
seeing increased engagement on Slack.

Over the past quarter, we've made progress in these areas:

- Our monthly Community Office Hours are no longer attracting as many attendees,
we’ve attempted to refocus on community driven activities such as lightning
talks from the Summer Mentorship, LF AI/ML course release, and managing OSS
project.

- Our next Office Hours on Nov 13 will focus on Open Source & Security Africa
initiative driven by several BEAR WG meetings whose goal is to expand awareness
of OSS and OpenSSF into African communities.

- Our meeting and Office Hours recordings are available on YouTube, improving
accessibility.

- Started discussions about OpenSSF sponsorship and participation in
[OSCAFEST](https://festival.oscafrica.org/) or
[AfricaCyberFest](https://africacyberfest.com/) in 2026 through the OSS Africa
group to support their growth as thought leaders.

- Part [two of the 3-pt series blog](https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/22/from-beginner-to-builder-your-first-code-contribution/) has been released. Written by
Sal Kimmich and Ejiro Oghenekome called "From Beginner to Builder:Your First
Code Contribution"

- Due to lack of attendance and volunteers, we have not started movement on the
[Tip of the Months](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_lhG_M0N9ExltfGOQebldnVCbGTzwx5aR-8itqfEAs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.639rwkkwm4ka) and collaborating with
the working group for quotes and links for the specific projects.

**Community Office Hours**

**Purpose**

Our Community Office Hours are a monthly event in which a panel of industry
experts discuss a specific topic relevant to the WG's mission. Each month, we
aim to host diverse speakers that represent different underrepresented groups,
elevating different voices and connecting different communities.

**Current Status**

The first few quarters, we hoped to host Office Hours that were a bit more
community and culture oriented. Unfortunately, due to dwindling attendance, we
decided to pivot back to topics that are especially relevant to newcomers to
OSS and the cybersecurity industry, while also sharing the voices and journey of
our community:

- August 28: LFX Summer ‘25 Mentorship Lighting Talks [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_U-A7AD_Qks?si=5iZsS74ErPYWEwkx)

- Sept 25: How do I manage an OSS project? [YouTube](https://youtu.be/fgFpyDmR7Uk?si=1HjprWJhJMVI2f9G)

- Oct 23: Securing the AI Future with next generation contributors [YouTube](https://youtu.be/05MiOqrgCvk?si=XDhjXIY36kO3fMiJ)

**Up Next**

In the remainder of Q4 2025, we are planning the following Community Office Hours:

- Nov 13: Open Source & Security Africa Overview & Updates

Due to time constraints on our WG members, we have stopped
[documenting Office Hour recaps](https://github.com/ossf/wg-dei/pull/9) to
enhance our YouTube videos and/or be submitted as blog posts.

**Open Source & Security Africa**

**Purpose**

The mission of BEAR is to foster a more diverse and inclusive cybersecurity work
force by implementing strategies to increase representation and enhance
effectiveness through advocacy, collaboration, and tailored initiatives. Our
biggest contributors for this working group have come from communities in Africa
seeking to expand OpenSSF and OSS into their communities, making this more
accessible and aware to their colleagues.

**Current Status**

- A group of 4 members have come together to coordinate their efforts in this
expansion 

- The members have been meeting weekly and established a partnership with
CodeTopia Community to start bringing awareness there. 

- We are in discussion with OpenSSF about support for [OSCAFEST](https://festival.oscafrica.org/) or [AfricaCyberFest](https://africacyberfest.com/) in 2026. 

- The team will discuss their vision and challenges at the next BEAR Office
hours and formalize this initiative as a SIG under the working group before the
end of the year.


**Panel Discussions at Major Conferences**

**Purpose**

Members of the OpenSSF BEAR WG community host panel discussions at major
industry conferences to raise awareness about the WG and to engage with folks
beyond the OpenSSF. A primary goal of the discussions is for panelists to share
their experiences and advice for newcomers to the OSS and cybersecurity space.

**Upcoming CFP Submissions in Discussion**

We did not submit any talks for the remainder of 2025. The team is reviewing CFP
submissions for 2026.

We have also started discussions about OpenSSF sponsorship and participation in
OSCAFEST or AfricaCyberFest in 2026. The WG plans to prepare CFP submission at
one or both of these conferences as well.

*2026 Roadmap Planning*

While we've gotten positive feedback about the current meetings the BEAR WG
hosts, we've gotten feedback about certain other spaces our community would like
to have available to them. In the coming months, we hope to begin hosting
OpenSSF Welcome Calls, BEAR Hour and establish more community-specific Slack
channels in 2026. The team will be drafting their roadmap during the Nov 18
BEAR WG call.

*Welcome Calls*

The discussions about creating Welcome Calls are ongoing with members of the
DevRel community, so that we can make it easier for newcomers to navigate and
find a good entry point into a WG / project. OpenSSF Welcome Calls would give
new community members an overview of the ongoing OpenSSF initiatives and
describe ways to get involved. We are hoping to collaborate with the DevRel
community on this effort.

As a preliminary effort, Ejiro Oghenekome and Sal Kimmich are writing a series
of blog posts with the goal of demystifying OpenSSF WGs and SIGs, providing
guidance for newcomers, and information about free online courses provided by
OpenSSF. We are waiting for the release date of the third blog post in the
series titled “From Beginner to Builder.”

*Tips of the Month*

We have started to craft out the tips of the month. We are hoping to collaborate
with Marketing and other OSS projects to provide contributor quotes and links to
drive further contributions to the projects. 

**Questions/Issues for the TAC**

For our BEAR office hours, we welcome suggestions on topics and speakers for
next year, guidance and advice for the Open Source & Security Africa group,  as
well as your continuous support and event sharing of the BEAR working group
activities.
