## Securing Software Repositories Working Group

### Purpose

Improve security of software repositories by providing a forum for discussion, a maturity model for security roadmaps, and guidance for individual security capabilities. These conversations, roadmaps, and guidance help ecosystems learn from each other, which accelerates the deployment of security capabilities.

### Current Status

- ["Crafting a Package Deletion Policy"](https://repos.openssf.org/package-deletion-policies) published, completing https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/414.
- ["UI/UX support for attestations on software repos"](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/424) funding approved, contractors identified, awaiting SOWs.
- [Rubygems now supports publishing attestations](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8239)
- npm is working on trusted publishing for release "this summer" and our [Trusted Publishing guide](https://repos.openssf.org/trusted-publishers-for-all-package-repositories) has been helpful
- Meetings continue every other week, with async discussions in the Slack channel

### Up Next

- Project kickoff: "UI/UX support for attestations on software repos"
- Continue supporting landing security capabilities in software repositories!
- Publish more guidance from community-suggested topics, like:
  - Handling pre-compiled binaries vs arbitrary code execution at install-time 
  - How to shut down a package repository that is no longer being maintained
  - Architecture choices and trade-offs for a new package repository being written from scratch

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

- None at this time
