# 2025 Q3 Security Tooling WG

## Overview
The [Security Tooling WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling) continues to focus on the tools that open source maintainers and developers need to create secure software.  In recent years, much of this has focused on Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) work but the group is expanding to other areas that touch on the groups core objectives to:
- Identify available security tools
- Evaluate the efficacy of those tools
- Help improve those tools
- Develop new tools where needed
- Ease deployment of security tools for open source developers

The group continues to be active and is currently in the process of expanding the number of projects it has.

- Most projects continue to move forward with momentum
- Need to work on bringing one project back in or find a new home
- One project is showing renewed effort in OpenSSF
- One new project and potentially another on the way

## Reliable Software Decomposition SIG
Chair: Scott More
Co-chairs: 
- Binoy Ravindran
- Ryan O'Neill

The [Reliable Software Decomposition SIG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling/blob/main/sig-lifecycle-documents/Reliable_Software_Decomposition_SIG.md) has the goal to develop a set of standard practices (enabled toolchain flags, features, etc.) and/or extensions to ELF and associated toolchains to enable fully automated, reliable disassembly of resulting binaries.

Initial deliverables include:
 - A list of existing areas where current disassemblers must rely on heuristics
 - A list of existing sources of metadata that could address these deficiencies if enabled
 - A list of gaps that could be addressed with additional metadata generated by toolchains

Just starting.  Literally had their 3rd-meeting this week.

## Fuzz Introspector
Co-Chairs:
- David Korczynski
- Adam Korczynski

The [Fuzz Introspector](https://github.com/ossf/fuzz-introspector) is an existing project under OpenSSF.  We recently got a recommitment from the developers to OpenSSF.  Jeff Diecks is working to bring their paperwork up to date.  It is actively developed with many dozens of commits this year.  We need to work with them to help ensure they create a roadmap and are following all OpenSSF processes.

Fuzz introspector is a tool to help fuzzer developers to get an understanding of their fuzzer’s performance and identify any potential blockers. Fuzz introspector aggregates the fuzzers’ functional data like coverage, hit frequency, entry points, etc to give the developer a birds eye view of their fuzzer. This helps with identifying fuzz bottlenecks and blockers and eventually helps in developing better fuzzers.

## SBOM Everywhere SIG
Chair: Josh Bressers Co-chair: Kate Stewart

The [SBOM Everywhere SIG](https://github.com/ossf/sbom-everywhere) continues to be very active with 6-12 individuals attending weekly.  There is great collaboration taking place across a wide variety of organizations including private companies, standards bodies and CISA.

- Keeping up to date on changes in [SPDX](https://spdx.dev), [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org), and [CISA workgroups](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) through participation from and collaboration with key representatives of those organizations
- Following governmental changes related to SBOMs including CISA's work on updating minimum elements in SBOMs for USG and German push for "AI BOMs"
- [Ongoing efforts](https://github.com/ossf/sbom-everywhere/issues/112) to refine and publish a whitepaper around [BOMOps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPMlmZK8XFHTMqTJcoVmj56ERwU2K84VtHTajZF2Ikk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.uweqougndqvk)
- Conveying input into the updated [SBOM minimum elements Framing document](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/framing-software-component-transparency-2024)
- Continued update and maintenance of the [SBOM Tooling Catalog](https://sbom-catalog.openssf.org/).

## SBOMit
Lead: Justin Cappos

The [SBOMit specification](https://github.com/SBOMit/specification) defines how [in-toto](https://in-toto.io) attestations can be incorporated into SBOMs.  This is important because in-toto attestations are a key building block for identifying building blocks in software supply chains.

The SBOMit team continues to work towards an evolution of the current specification.  The group has 5 core attendees from multiple organizations with participation from other groups as well.  Note that progress slows dramatically over summer when college is out.  Some of the key issues being examined:

- Creating a PoC for an SBOMit strace tool
- Looking at more metadata from in-toto.
- Continued collaboration with Protobom to support properties and annotations
- Exploring two different types of attestation for a project; single attestation from build process and multiple attestation.

NOTE: An [Issue](https://github.com/SBOMit/specification/issues/28) has been created for SBOMit to update their [roadmap](https://github.com/SBOMit/specification/wiki/SBOMit-Roadmap).

## Protobom
Lead: Adolfo Garcia Veytia

[Protobom](https://github.com/protobom/protobom), the protocol buffers representation of SBOM data, continues to be an active project though it has slowed down since it's last release.  Many of the other SBOM related projects at OpenSSF continue to use Protobom technology as the basis of their efforts.  Protobom 0.5.2 was released March 4th including:

- Rewrite to cdx recursion
- Move to use io.Writer instead of WriterCloser
- Initialization of CycloneDX options to the CDX serializer.

Protobom continues to actively collaborate with other OpenSSF SBOM projects.

### TAC Request

Can TAC recommend a someone knowledgeable in Go to help Protobom?  For SPDX 3.0 support, they need someone to help refactor Go code for Protobom and Protobom has no Go experts.

## Bomctl

The [Bomctl](https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl) project is a format-agnostic SBOM tool intended to bridge the gap between SBOM generation and SBOM analysis tools focusing on supporting complex SBOM operations on multiple SBOM files.  Continues with significant participation though a number of members have been re-tasked with other work.  It released [v0.4.3](https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/releases/tag/v0.4.3) on May 2nd.  

- They continue to collaborate with Protobom on features and support for bomctl
- v0.4.3 release includes support for GitLab push to generic package registries
- Enabled Minder for entire bomctl GitHub org

## Minder
Co-Chair: Evan Anderson
Co-Chair: Juan Antonio Osorio

[Minder](https://github.com/mindersec/minder) is an open source platform allowing project owners to proactively manage the security posture of several aspects of their SDLC, including their repos, by providing pluggable and customizable checks and policies to minimize risk along their software supply chain and to attest their security practices to downstream consumers.

- Has been a little shakeup and slowdown of Minder progress since Stacklok's step back
- However, project still continues moving forward and has done two releases ([v0.0.88](https://github.com/mindersec/minder/releases/tag/v0.0.88) and [v0.0.89](https://github.com/mindersec/minder/releases/tag/v0.0.89)) with significant changes and a new contributor.
- Continued commitment from team to work with Scorecard and Allstar on areas of overlap

## Fuzzing Collaboration
Chair: Jonathan Metzman

The OSS Fuzzing SIG (Fuzzing Collaboration) continues its work of supporting open source developers with their fuzzing needs.  Participation in the group has been spotty.  Jeff Diecks has been working with them to determine if it might be best for the project to find a better umbrella to be under where they might get more participation.

## Questions/Issues for the TAC

No general requests at this time

## Additional Information

We have been approached by the lead maintainer of the [cve-bin-tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool) project.  They are looking to have Intel donate cve-bin-tool to OpenSSF.  Being a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solution for both binaries and SBOMs, it is a natural fit for OpenSSF which does not currently have an SCA solution.
