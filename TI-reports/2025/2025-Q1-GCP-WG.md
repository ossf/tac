# 2025 Q1 Global Cybersecurity Policy Working Group

## Overview

GitHub repo: https://github.com/ossf/wg-globalcyberpolicy/
Minutes doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAplSQheMgemdMnEw74uPj3oi_6rLLbFFXhg4svqIDo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9m0zi4b0wnne 

This group has been formed in January 2025. The scope of the group is to provide a forum for our members and the broarder community to collaborate on Global Cybersecurity-related legislation, frameworks, and standards which facilitate conformance to regulatory requirements by open source projects and their consumers. We have been holidng bi-weekly calls. We have agreed [our charter](https://github.com/ossf/wg-globalcyberpolicy/blob/main/CHARTER.md) and formed 3 SIGs - Awareness, Tooling and Standards. The group is focusing most of its attention on the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). We also have drafted a [liaisons list](https://github.com/ossf/wg-globalcyberpolicy/blob/main/governance/external-liaisons.md) which is a list of external organizations we feel we need to liaise with.

We are also exploring folding in the "CRA tech bi-weekly" call into the remit of this group.

We have spent a fair amount of time refining the charter, in particular the wording around how we open up the group as much as possible while also making it clear who gets to vote when and if a vote is required.

We now have a schedule of calls for our SIGs and have started to take minutes in our main minutes doc. We are operating in a similar mode to the Best Practices Working group, with our SIGs reporting into the main working group call. 

We held a special session at LF Member Summit which is also minuted in our minutes doc.

## Awareness SIG

The awareness SIG is working on activites that drive awareness of the work of this group and of the regulatory landscape in general. The SIG has been marshalling blog posts, upcoming conference schedule, as well as the CRA introductory course.

## Tooling SIG

Tooling workstream has [need something more...]

## Standards SIG

Standards workstream is still getting up to speed. One area of focus will be promoting Baseline as a potential "standard" that can help the ecosystem comply with the CRA.
