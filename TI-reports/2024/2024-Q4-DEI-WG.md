# 2024 Q4 DEI WG

Chairs: [Marcela Melara](https://github.com/marcelamelara), [Yesenia Yser](https://github.com/Cyber-JiuJiteria) and [Jay White](https://github.com/camaleon2016)

## Overview

The DEI WG continues our mission to increase representation and strengthen
the overall effectiveness of the cybersecurity workforce. The WG continues to
see relatively low regular attendance in meetings (5 attendees on avg),
we are seeing increased engagement on Slack.

Over the past quarter, we've made progress in these areas:

* Our monthly Community Office Hours have been regularly attracting 10+ attendees (on average).
* Our meeting and Office Hours recordings are available on YouTube, improving access.

## Community Office Hours

### Purpose

Our Community Office Hours are a monthly event in which a panel of industry
experts discuss a specific topic relevant to the WG's mission.
Each month, we aim to host diverse speakers that represent different
underrepresented groups, elevating different voices and connecting different
communities.

### Current Status

Since July, our Community Office Hours series has focused on topics especially
relevant to newcomers to OSS and the cybersecurity industry:

* July 25: Getting Started in OSS and Cybersecurity (recording TBA)
    - Speakers: Yesenia Yser, Marcela Melara; Moderator: CRob
* Aug 22: [Submitting to a CFP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRYkMHp49fw)
    - Speakers: Lori Lorusso, Katherine Druckman, Khahil White; Moderator: Yesenia Yser
* Sep 26: [Finding Mentors and Community in OSS/Cybersecurity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2NEUYuVxSo)
    - Speakers: Ijeoma Onwuka, Santiago Torres Arias; Moderator: Marcela Melara
* Oct 31: [How to Effectively Pitch Your Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVttmuybqYY)
    - Speakers: Fatima Alam, Jeneba Wint; Moderator: Ijeoma Onwuka

### Up Next

We are planning one more Community Office Hour before the end of 2024
continuing our theme of newcomer-oriented topics:

* Dec 5: How to Grow Your Brand

We are also in the process of [documenting Office Hour recaps](https://github.com/ossf/wg-dei/pull/9)
to enhance our YouTube videos and/or be submitted as blog posts.

Looking ahead to 2025, we plan to continue our series in January with
a discussion on neurodiversity in OSS.

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

We welcome topic and speaker suggestions for the upcoming year!

## 2025 Goals

We have an number of new activities the WG would like to focus on in 2025:

* **Tip of the Month**: This will be a monthly series of social media posts,
in which we highlight a specific OpenSSF community member and a career or
tech tip they would like to share with the OpenSSF and beyond.

While we had initially intended to begin this activity in August, the WG has
decided to delay this activity to 2025 due to a number of factors.

* **Mentorship**: Ahead of summer 2025, the WG is seeking collaboration with
other OpenSSF TIs to enroll in the [LFX mentorship program](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/). This will expose new and future
contributors to OpenSSF efforts while also advancing our efforts. As part of
this activity, the WG will likely also apply for funds to sponsor these
mentorships.

* **Inclusive Contributing Guidelines**: There have been [a](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/330) [few](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169) asks
to the TAC regarding the attraction and retention of maintainers. Working
together with other OpenSSF TIs, we aim to develop a small and approachable
set of contributing guidelines that focus on clear directions for project
newcomers and practices that facilitate different types of contributions.
The end goal is for our software and spec TIs to adopt these guidelines
as part of their lifecycle requirements.

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

The DEI WG intends to drive these activities, but need's the TAC's help in
engaging other TIs in our mentorship and contributing guidelines activities.

At this point, can the TAC assist with outreach to stakeholders of a few
projects/TIs that would be interested in these activities?

Beyond the upcoming work, we always appreciate the TAC's support in
amplifying the activities of this WG.
