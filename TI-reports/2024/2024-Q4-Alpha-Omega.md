# 2024 Q4 Alpha-Omega

## Overview

The Alpha-Omega Directed Fund continues our mission, to catalyze sustainable security improvements to the world's most critical
open source projects and ecosystems. We do this by applying funding and influence in four key areas:

* Staffing dedicated security roles within critical ecosystems/foundations
* Funding work to improve security for artifact repositories / package registries
* Funding security audits and remediation, often as a precusor to additional work
* Experimentation

### Recent Updates

We publish monthly updates at <https://alpha-omega.dev/resources/reports>, including highlights from our
engagement partners. We also collect more detailed status updates from each our engagement partners at
<https://github.com/ossf/alpha-omega/tree/main/alpha/engagements/>.

In addition, we can offer the following recent updates:

* **Alpha-Omega Roundtable**: We held a roundtable for Alpha-Omega partners and friends at the Open Source Summit
  in Vienna. We had a lively discussion on many topics, including end-of-life transitions for open source projects,
  and how to better market our successes to drive awareness and further investment.
  
* **AI Library Reviews**: The security audit of 25 of the most popular AI libraries has wrapped up, and we're currently
  discussing next steps, and will share details when we're able to.

* **Engagement**: We recently expanded our engagement with Node.js to cover OpenJS, started an engagement with
  Trail of Bits to improve PyPI's project-level lifecycle functionality, and kicked off a new type of engagement ("Beach Cleaning")
  with Apache Airflow and its 700+ dependencies. We also renewed funding for the ClangBuiltLinux project, and kicked
  off work to bring Content Security Policy (CSP) to Jenkins, which will better protect Jenkins infrastructure from vulnerable plugins.
  Details about each of these engagement are available in our GitHub repository.

## Objectives & Key Results

All of our OKRs are on-track except for KR 2.1.

|Key Result|Status|
|-|-|
|**O1: Catalyze trustworthy and secure software, runtimes, and infrastructure for all the major open source ecosystems through staffing**||
|KR 1.1: Fund security improvements and initiatives for at least ten critical open source organizations by the end of 2024. |On target|
|KR 1.2: For each engagement, confirm progress toward improved security outcomes, evidenced through initial and/or follow-on assessments, monthly reporting, and periodic check-ins.|On target|
|KR 1.3: Drive the organizations we work with to obtain security funding from at least one organization other than Alpha-Omega, targeting 33% by the end of 2024.|On target|
|KR 1.4: Organize quarterly roundtables for at least 5 major ecosystems  to share information, build connections, and collaborate, resulting in at least one new project or joint publication started in 2024.|On target|
|**O2: The top 10,000 open source projects are free of critical security vulnerabilities**||
|KR 2.1: Drive adoption of key security processes, including static analysis, credential scanning, the use of private vulnerability disclosures, structured metadata (Security Insights) and the use of multi-factor authentication by maintainers of 500 critical projects from the top 10,000 by the end of 2024.|Not Started|
|KR 2.2: Independently scan, triage, and notify maintainers when critical vulnerabilities are found in 2,000 projects, chosen from the top 10,000 by the end of June 2024, with emphasis on clearing a "section of the beach" by focusing on the top PyPI packages.|On target|
|KR 2.3: Publish in a machine readable format the attestations for all packages from 2.2 that returned no vulnerabilities and those that found vulnerabilities which were subsequently fixed and verified.|On target|
|**O3: Enhance Alpha-Omega's effectiveness in driving security improvements through deliberate innovation and experimentation**||
|KR 3.1: By the end of 2024, run three experiments to explore new strategies for reducing security risk within the open source ecosystems, share the results/learnings, using them to refine our overall strategy and objectives for 2025.|On Target|
|**O4: Run an operationally efficient and effective program**||
|KR 4.1: Allocate at least 85% of our yearly spend to activities directly in support of our mission.|On Target|
|KR 4.2: Receive at least $5 million in renewed funding in 2024.|Completed|
|KR 4.3: For each partner engagement, at least 70% of the objectives defined within the respective agreement are met within the defined time period.|On target|

### Purpose

To catalyze sustainable security improvements to the world's most critical open source projects and ecosystems.

### Current Status

We're active and healthy. Our team consists of Henri Yandell (Amazon Web Services), Bob Callaway (Google), and Michael Scovetta (Microsoft), 
supported by Michael Winser (independent) and Michelle Martineau and Tracy Li from the Linux Foundation.

We've received $5M in funding in 2024 and are on target to spend over $6M by the end of the year. 


### Up Next

We'll be at the Linux Foundation Member Summit next week, sponsoring a Happy Hour for OpenSSF Governing Board and TAC
on 11/17 from 5-6 PM at the Mansion Bar & Terrace (at the Silverado Resort). We hope to see you there.

We continue to hold monthly public meetings (on the OpenSSF community calendar).

Our 2024 Annual Report will be published in early January 2025.

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

No, but as always, we're eager for substantive discussion with TAC and others.
