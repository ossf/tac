# 2024 Q4 Vulnerability Disclosure WG


## Overview
The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping develop and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. We serve open source maintainers and developers, assist security researchers, and help downstream open source software consumers.

The Vulnerability Disclosure Working group is officially a [Graduated-level](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md) working group within the OpenSSF <img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/files/images/OpenSSF_StagesBadges_graduated.png" width="100" height="100">>
