# 2026 Q1 Securing Software Repositories Working Group

## Overview

We held the Package Manager Security Forum and are considering which items to take up for 2026.

## Securing Software Repositories Working Group

### Purpose

Improve security of software repositories by providing a forum for discussion, a maturity model for security roadmaps, and guidance for individual security capabilities. These conversations, roadmaps, and guidance help ecosystems learn from each other, which accelerates the deployment of security capabilities.

### Current Status

- We held the Package Manager Security Forum in Brussels earlier this month
  - 8 large package managers attended
  - Top topics: funding, documenting policy, coordinated incident response, defending against malware, and audit logs of maintainer activity

### Up Next

- Pick some items to document! Audit logs is a top contender.

- Look into setting up coordinated incident response channel

### Funding requests

No funding requests planned, but here's an update on the concluded 2025 funding requests:

- [UI/UX support for attestations on software repos](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/424) completed in [November 2025](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos/issues/68)
  - Lots of positive feedback from the repos we worked with, as well as repos considering attestations in the future
  - Eriol Fox, one of the folks we worked with on this project, has [given presentations about how UX and open source projects can work together more](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HCQRVT-designing_attestations_ui_the_security_and_safety_of_oss_package_supply_chain/)

- [Technical Writer for Package Yanking Guidance](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/414) landed in [April 2025](https://repos.openssf.org/package-deletion-policies)
  - Alpha Omega, package repositories, and folks running package manager-like systems have all expressed appreciation for this guidance

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

None at this time.

## Additional Information
