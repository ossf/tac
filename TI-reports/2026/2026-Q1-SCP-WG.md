# 2026 Q1 Securing Critical Projects Working Group

## Overview

- Only activity under Malicious Packages project. Criticality score continues to run.
- Just 1-2 Meetings since last update
- Jeff interested in facilitating (OpenSSF Group Redesign & Alignment Proposal)[https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/551]
- [2025-Q4 Update](https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/535)

## Identifying Critical Projects

### Purpose

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons"
problem. Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many
projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together. We
need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that
can provide them with support.

## Criticality Score

### Purpose

1. Generate a criticality score for every open source project.

1. Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends
   on.

1. Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of these critical
   projects.

### Current Status

- No changes, but continues to run and generate updated scores.
- Funding under question
- Further scale down the cluster to determine lowest running costs.

### Up Next

- 

### Funding requests

- Potentially. Waiting to see how Scorecard plays out, as this would be similar (ongoing funding).

## Package Analysis

### Purpose

The Package Analysis project analyses the capabilities of packages available on
open source repositories. The project looks for behaviors that indicate
malicious software:

- What files do they access?
- What addresses do they connect to?
- What commands do they run?

The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify
when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously.

This effort is meant to improve the security of open source software by
detecting malicious behavior, informing consumers selecting packages, and
providing researchers with data about the ecosystem.

### Current Status

- No major updates
- Continues to be used for discovering Malicious Packages.

## Malicious Packages

### Purpose

Malicious Packages is a collection of reports of malicious packages identified in
Open Source package repositories, consumable via the Open Source Vulnerability
(OSV) format.

The aim of this project and repository is to be a comprehensive, high quality, open source database of reports of malicious packages published on open source package repositories.

These public reports help protect the open source community, and provide a data source for the security community to improve their ability to find and detect new open source malware.

### Current Status

- Regular submissions and activity
- Malicious Package report grouping for campaigns to aid in discovery and response
- Caleb plans to work on solving this this year. Ideally having a solution in H1 of this year. There is some demand for solving this issue.
- AWS is an automated source
- Kam193 added as an automated source for PyPI reports
