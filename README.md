## Charter

The TAC is chartered as part of the [Open Source Security Foundation Charter](https://openssf.org/about/charter/).

## Technical Initiatives

The governance of TIs is documented in [the process section](process). This section provides you with all the information about the different types of initiatives and how they are managed, as well as how to propose a new initiative. It also covers the different levels of maturity a TI can be in, the requirements that must be met to move up to the next level, as well as the benefits that come with each level.

The following Technical Initiatives have been approved by the TAC. You may learn more about their status through their [quarterly reports](TI-reports).

### Overview Diagrams

Diagrams with an overview of the OpenSSF, including its projects and SIGs, are available in the presentation [OpenSSF Introduction (including Diagrammers’ Society diagrams)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DpB-WPz4yimdF7DDH4waR_zdi7X5WumgoptcqwkMg-s/edit?usp=sharing) as created and maintained by the [OpenSSF Diagrammer's Society](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society).


## Antitrust Policy

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy>. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
