|Arnaud J Le Hors| Prounouns: He/Him Company: IBM [GitHub](https://github.com/lehors/) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lehors/)|Having been a contributor to Open Source since 1990 I take the attacks against open source very seriously. This is why I've invested in OpenSSF since its relaunch in 2022 and continue to work on helping make it successful. It is on that basis that I seek re-election on the TAC. As proof of my commitment to the TAC consider that with very few exceptions I have attended about every TAC call since 2022. If re-elected I will continue working with other TAC members on ensuring a smooth operation, while looking for ways to improve so that OpenSSF can deliver on its critical mission for the benefit of all.
|Carlos Tadeu Panato Junior| Prounouns: He/Him Company: Chainguard [GitHub](https://github.com/cpanato) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpanato/)|I am deeply committed to advancing open source security through active technical contributions, primarily within the Sigstore and Scorecard projects. My work on Sigstore has focused on making software supply chain security accessible and practical for all developers, contributing to a project that has fundamentally changed how we approach code signing and verification in the open source ecosystem. Through my contributions to Scorecard, I've helped organizations assess and improve their security postures by providing actionable insights into repository security practices. This work directly addresses one of the most critical challenges in open source: making security best practices measurable and achievable. I want to amplify the voices of individual contributors who are driving OpenSSF's technical initiatives forward. My hands-on experience with these projects has given me insight into both the challenges contributors face and the opportunities for broader community engagement. I understand the importance of balancing technical excellence with practical adoption, and I've seen firsthand how the right tools and standards can transform security practices across the ecosystem. I believe the Security Community needs representation from those actively building the solutions we advocate for. My continued technical involvement ensures I remain grounded in the real-world challenges and innovations happening across OpenSSF projects. I'm committed to fostering collaboration, supporting emerging contributors, and ensuring that individual voices shape the strategic direction of open source security. I'm ready to serve and advocate for our community's technical contributors.|
|Daniel Major| Prounouns: He/Him Company: NVIDIA [GitHub](https://github.com/major-security/) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-m-1a11b345/)|If selected by the community as an OpenSSF TAC member, I would continue the current TAC’s work to champion the alignment and cohesion of our technical initiatives. I believe our foundation's greatest impact comes from applying proven principles from one domain to solve new challenges in another. My passion is to build bridges between traditional software supply chain security and the urgent needs of the AI ecosystem. My commitment to this within the OpenSSF is demonstrated by my work co-chairing the Model Signing Project, where I co-led the development of the OpenSSF Model Signing (OMS) specification and continue as a maintainer. As a Distinguished Security Architect at NVIDIA, and previously the principal security architect of the BlackBerry mobile platform, I bring a deeply technical perspective on securing complex ecosystems. The current TAC has done an excellent job laying the groundwork and supporting our technical initiatives. As a TAC member, I want to build on that strong foundation and put this vision into practice, ensuring we build on our collective successes to solve our community's biggest challenges.|
|Georg Kunz| Prounouns: He/Him Company: Ericsson [GitHub](https://github.com/gkunz) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-kunz/)|I am an a director in Ericsson's Open Source Program Office and a member of the OpenSSF technical community since 2022. During this time, I have participated in various TIs, committees and working groups, such as the Best Practices WG, the End Users WG, and the Global Cyber Policy Working Group. In the Best Practices WG, I have facilitated the creation of two SIGs: the C/C++ Compiler Options Hardening Guide and the Python Secure Coding Guide. I am also a regular speaker at OpenSSF Community Days as well as other Linux Foundation events, where I talk about the OpenSSF and its initiatives. Since end of 2024 I am co-chairing the Best Practices WG, and I am serving on the OpenSSF TAC since 2025. Having served on the TAC during 2025, I'd like to renew my commitment to the OpenSSF community for another term and work towards two goals: i) growing the technical community by strengthening our efforts to address the practical needs open source developers and project maintainers, and ii) fostering the development of methods and tools which help organizations - and OSPOs - to achieve compliance to upcoming cyber security regulation.|
|Harald Fischer|Company: Ericsson [GitHub](https://github.com/fisehara) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harald-fischer-dus/)|My background is in embedded, medical device, and enterprise software, and I am now responsible for organisational and product cybersecurity at balena. balena has been developing and contributing to open source software from the beginning. This gives me direct experience in maturing open source projects to meet security and reliability demands of open, commercial and enterprise users. I want to contribute this experience to OpenSSF’s technical initiatives. The biggest challenge I see ahead for the community is navigating new regulations like the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act. As an active contributor, I believe my role is to help develop clear and easy guidance and practical frameworks. This will equip open source communities to provide needed and usable software for other initiatives and commercial users. I’d like to take the chance to strengthen my existing contributions to the OpenSSF on a broader level. I also want to learn from this community and collaborate with other leaders to improve the entire ecosystem.|
|Marcela Melara| Prounouns: She/Her Company: Intel Corporation [GitHub](https://github.com/marcelamelara) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcela-melara-285a4678/)|As supply chain security research lead at Intel, I collaborate closely with enterprise, open source and academic partners to develop practical software and AI security solutions. Beyond serving on the OpenSSF TAC since 2024, my main contributions to OpenSSF are through the SCI WG and the BEAR WG. I am a maintainer of SLSA where I continue to drive the upcoming SLSA BuildEnv track that extends build integrity requirements to the compute environment. As co-chair of the BEAR WG, I have created welcoming spaces for OSS newcomers and established the OpenSSF Mentorship Program. I see many opportunities to foster closer collaboration and more community growth via the OpenSSF TAC. I’m eager to contribute to OpenSSF initiatives in 2026. My team’s framework for ML model lifecycle provenance, which integrates supply chain tools like in-toto, SLSA and OpenSSF Model Signing, is slated to join the AI/ML WG. As part of my leadership of the BEAR WG, I hope to expand the scope of the Mentorship Program and bridge gaps to more OSS communities across the globe. While my contributions cover vastly different areas, I believe they are all crucial for achieving long-term OSS security. To me, the most exciting responsibility of the OpenSSF TAC is to support the growth of existing initiatives and the creation of new WGs. Another term on the TAC would enable me to continue championing the technical depth and breadth that equips OpenSSF to tackle the OSS security challenges we face in an increasingly AI-centric ecosystem.|
