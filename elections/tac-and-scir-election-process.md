# TAC and SCIR Election Procedures

This document outlines the election process for the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR).


## Voter Eligibility (Electorate) and Self-Nomination Process

Any contributor to OpenSSF working groups, SIGs, or projects is eligible to participate in the election.
Valid contributions include: commits or submitted pull requests via GitHub; public edits or comments on Google docs or other work products associated with OpenSSF; consistent participation in working groups; posting messages to any mailing list or on Slack; and beyond that any other form of positive engagement with OpenSSF activities.
The voter eligibility form asks you for an example of your contributions; this is merely to make it easier for the Election Officials and OpenSSF staff to validate eligibility.
If you have in any way been involved in or care about OpenSSF, but are in doubt as to whether your contribution “counts”, please fill it out anyways, and we will follow up.

The Voter Eligibility Self-Nomination Form will be sent out via email along with the election announcement.
(Note: The form is only open during the nomination period)


## TAC Self-Nomination Process

The OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is composed of nine total individuals, six of whom are elected by the community, three of which are appointed by the Governing Board.  TAC seats are for 2 year terms, 50% of which are open for community vote every year.  The Governing Board-appointed seats are for a one-year term.

Eligible community members, according to the same criteria defined above for voter eligibility, can self-nominate using the form below.

The TAC Candidate Self-Nomination Form will be sent out via email along with the election announcement.
(Note: The form is only open during the nomination period)


## SCIR Self-Nomination Information and Process

Since early in its existence, the OpenSSF Governing Board has sought to ensure it gets adequate input from voices in the software security community who would otherwise not be at the table.
We seek candidates for the Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR) who can represent those voices, while also being a subject matter expert in the field with their own set of perspectives.
Familiarity with the different OpenSSF working groups and projects, and being able to dedicate the time to be sufficiently informed on the issues that arise in our monthly calls and ongoing discussions, is highly desired.
It is also highly desired, but not required, that the SCIR be an eligible OpenSSF community member by the criteria defined above.

The SCIR Candidate Self-Nomination Form will be sent out via email along with the election announcement.
(Note: The form is only open during the nomination period)


## Election Process

The Election Process will be monitored by Election Officials, who
* review nominees and confirm their eligibility,
* approve the updated election timeline for the current year, and
* review the ballot request form and validate voter eligibility.

Election Officials are eligible community members who have volunteered to oversee and help ensure the integrity of the election process. By volunteering in this role, they recuse themselves from running for a TAC or SCIR position but they still are allowed to vote in the election.

Candidates for each election will be reviewed by the Election Officials to ensure their eligibility per the guidelines above. At the end of the validation period, the complete list of candidates will be published in this repo.

Similarly, the pool of eligible voters will be reviewed by Election Officials to ensure that all voters meet the eligibility criteria established above. If a ballot requester is considered ineligible, the requester will be notified directly by one of the Election Officials.

If there are more nominees than positions for either the TAC or the SCIR, the election will be conducted using an electronic voting tool.
The [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) method will be used to vote for TAC members as there are multiple candidates for multiple positions.
Eligible voters will receive an invitation to access their ballot from Opavote.
The ballot will include the option to vote for both the TAC and SCIR.

If the number of eligible nominees is less than the number of open positions, then all eligible nominees will be appointed and a second nomination phase for filling the remaining positions will be opened.
If the number of eligible nominees equals the number of open positions, then those nominees will be elected unopposed.

If one nominates themselves both for the TAC and SCIR elections, in case they are elected for the TAC they will be removed from the results of the SCIR election. The next candidate will then be elected for the SCIR position.

Calls for volunteers, nominations, and registration and reminders will be sent broadly via email and on Slack to all Technical Initiatives and general forums.

If an elected member steps down from their position more than 2 months before the end of their term the next candidate from the last election results will be offered the position.


Questions related to the nomination and/or election process should be directed to [operations@openssf.org](mailto:operations@openssf.org).


## Appointment Process

The Governing Board will appoint three people from the list of TAC and SCIR Nominees excluding those who got elected. The Governing Board will be provided with the results of the election from the community so that they can ensure appropriate diversity of the TAC during their vote.


## TAC Chair and Vice Chair Election

After the results of the community elections and Governing Board appointments are announced, the TAC members will elect a [Chair and a Vice Chair](/process/tac-member-R&Rs.md#tac-chair).

The TAC Chair nomination period shall commence as soon as new TAC members are elected (typically, around the beginning of the year) and shall conclude at the end of the first TAC meeting of the year.

The voting period is 1 week, starting immediately after the conclusion of the nomination period. OpenSSF staff will coordinate the election process and results will be announced soon after all votes have been cast.

The candidate with the most votes will serve as Chair and the candidate receiving the second-most votes will serve as Vice Chair.

***The Chair may instead choose to serve as the Vice Chair, if agreed to by the newly-selected Vice Chair.***
