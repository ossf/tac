   <td>The OpenSSF continues to drive forward the security of the open source ecosystem, but there's plenty of work left to do. The TAC needs to continue to make the Technical Initiative (TI) process more clear and straightforward, something I experienced first-hand in helping the AI/ML Working Group (WG) get accepted at the Sandbox stage. Over the past months, I revised the Special Interest Group lifecycle process to make it more clear and straightforward, as well participated in the Operating Model Committee to standardize the lifecycle process across all TIs. In terms of concrete security capabilities, as a co-chair of the Securing Software Repositories WG I authored "Build Provenance for All Package Registries" describing how we integrated build provenance with npm and how other registries could do the same. Soon after, the WG published a proposal "Build Provenance and Code-signing for Homebrew", which was subsequently funded by Alpha Omega and is in the process of being implemented. The WG also adopted the Repository Service for TUF project which is helping RubyGems protect its package index from malicious tampering. I'm also an active contributor to the Sigstore project.
<p>
In short, I want to serve another term on the OpenSSF TAC to continue making our organization easier to understand and work with, to ensure our proposed security capabilities are easy to use with minimal burden on maintainers and consumers, and to ensure these capabilities deliver meaningful security impact in the next year.

<p>
I believe I can contribute because – as a member of the Google Open Source Security Upstream Team [1] – I've spent the last year-and-a-half working to directly improve the supply-chain security of critical projects (many in the OpenSSF Critical Projects List). This included suggesting adoption of OpenSSF tooling such as the Scorecard Action, adding SLSA to release workflows or other improvements guided by Scorecard (over 210 PRs so far!) [2].
<p>
Through this work, I've gained a thorough understanding of many OpenSSF tools and how they are used and perceived by open-source maintainers. I've forwarded what I've learned (maintainer feedback, feature requests, bug reports) to the relevant OpenSSF maintainers to incorporate that feedback in their tools [3]. I've also contributed PRs to some projects (including Scorecard's Contributor Ladder) [4].
<p>
I also presented at this year's Open Source Summit Europe [5], presenting supply-chain security best practices and Scorecard.

   <td>When I joined OpenSSF over 2 years ago I found it very difficult to find out what was going on across the organization, which groups existed, what they were doing, and how they functioned. With over 25 years working in standards and open source communities in different roles I decided to put my experience to the service of the OpenSSF community and work on addressing these problems.
<p>
This is why for the last 2+ years I’ve spent a lot of my time and energy towards improving OpenSSF’s governance structure and process, as well as participating in various groups to provide them with guidance in that regard. Although it’s taking longer than I’d like, we’ve made some serious progress that has put us on the right track for the community to start seeing the results.
<p>
It’s been an honor to serve as a TAC member appointed by the Governing Board for the last year and I hope you will trust me to continue as a TAC member by voting for me so that I can pursue my effort to improve OpenSSF. Its critical mission will only be achieved if we can grow OpenSSF into a well-functioning organization in which all interested parties can have confidence and can easily engage.

I have a track record of driving results in my work with W3C and other organizations. As someone based outside the US, I also offer international experience and focus – in particular with my role as a member of the UK Government’s Open Standards board.
<p>
Since becoming involved in OpenSSF, I have become an actively engaged member and contributor to the Best Practices, End User, and Tooling working groups. I have contributed to OpenSSF work items such as the SCM best practices, the SBOM everywhere implementation plan and the SBOM naming conventions. This summer I also planned and chaired a joint workshop with W3C, OWASP, and OpenJS Foundation on web developer security (“Secure the Web Forward” https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/).
<p>
If re-elected to the TAC, I would bring my experience driving consensus across diverse technical organizations to use to help drive awareness and engagement by more open source developers, maintainers and consumers. I would also put energy towards delivering on our stated “Public Good” value, drawing on my experience spearheading work on the Ethical Web Principles at W3C. I am also passionate about promoting diversity and inclusion in how we work and how we work with the developer community. I believe that security plays an essential role in ensuring a healthy and trustworthy ecosystem for all. The work we do at OpenSSF is vital to achieving this goal.

Serving on the OpenSSF TAC would allow me to support such cross-sector collaborations with an emphasis on holistic solutions.
<p>
My main contributions to OpenSSF have been through the SCI WG. Since 2020, I’ve helped develop and promote the SLSA framework as a SIG member and OpenSSF Tech Talk panelist. I also co-lead a new SLSA workstream enabling trusted hardware for enhanced build integrity. As a core maintainer for the CNCF in-toto project on supply chain attestation, I bring insights and connections from other areas of OSS. I see many opportunities for fostering closer collaboration with CNCF communities via the OpenSSf TAC.
<p>
I’m eager to contribute to newer OpenSSF initiatives in 2024. The holistic best practices of the Security Toolbelt strongly align with my research approach. The DEI WG’s work to create a community in which underrepresented folks feel empowered to contribute their ideas is vital. Understanding the impact of emerging areas like GenAI on OSS security and developing suitable solutions are interesting challenges for the AI/ML Security WG.
<p>
While these initiatives each cover very distinct topics, I believe they are all crucial for achieving long-term OSS security. Driving work that ensures all sectors are ready to tackle the big supply chain problems of today and tomorrow is why I seek to join the OpenSSF TAC.
