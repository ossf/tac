Serving as a maintainer of Istio, she holds positions on both the Istio Technical Oversight Committee and Steering Committee, providing valuable technical and administrative direction. She is also a member of the Istio Product Security Team which resolves all the security vulnerabilities issues of the project. She has a deep understanding of how Istio provides secure communication among microservices and generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Istio’s sources and releases. Lin has authored two books on Istio, both published by O'Reilly, and holds an impressive portfolio of more than 200 patents. Furthermore, Lin serves as a CNCF ambassador and holds the role of co-chair in the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG)-network. In this capacity, she focuses on the development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems within cloud-native environments.
   <p>
   With extensive experience in open-source software development and management, particularly in containers, service mesh, security and distributed systems, Lin is enthusiastic about facilitating collaboration between OpenSSF and CNCF projects. She aims to promote the adoption of best open-source security practices within some of the leading CNCF projects. Lin's background as an Istio maintainer and leader, CNCF ambassador, and TAG co-chair uniquely positions her to bring valuable insights from CNCF to OpenSSF. She is a member of the GUAC community and has already started to contribute to it from the lens of an Istio maintainer.

   <td>As the OpenSSF SCIR I will bring to the board a strong technical security community perspective. My 15+ year security career has been primarily developer- and community-focused. I will channel this energy and focus on developing the security capabilities of the OpenSSF and the broader open-source community. I am a product security engineer, architect, and leader with experience in all phases of the development process “from concept to end of life”, with an emphasis on security by design of software, hardware, and organizational systems. I co-authored “Threat Modeling: A Practical Guide for Development Teams”, co-creator of the Threat Modeling Manifesto, and a founding member and maintainer of the pytm project (an OWASP Incubator project for "threat modeling as code"). I have been actively involved in open community initiatives with participation in the Hardware CWE and CWE/CAPEC User Experience working groups (led by MITRE), OWASP, and the OpenSSF End User WG and Security Toolbelt SIG. I am also involved in efforts at SAFECode and FIRST. I work at Dell Technologies in the Product and Application Security team helping Dell product teams design and implement secure systems with responsible consumption and use of open-source components. I believe my experience lends itself well to the SCIR role of the OpenSSF GB, where I will utilize my experiences in developer focused security to ensure strategic efforts are consumable and actionable for the developer community at large.

   <td>I have been heavily involved in OpenSSF for the past few years. I started off contributing on behalf of an end user and now have co-founded a startup that is also heavily involved in the OpenSSF. I am a SLSA steering committee member and maintainer. I am co-creator and maintainer of GUAC, an incubating project. I am currently a TAC member and sponsor of GitTUF and SBOMit. I am heavily involved in the Security Toolbelt initiative. I am a regular attendee of multiple other working groups. I have also done a lot of work to push OpenSSF supply chain security initiatives through the work of the Supply Chain Integrity Working Group and regularly speaking at conferences like Open Source Summit, Kubecon, and OpenSSF day. I am also a CNCF TAG Security lead and help out with collaborative efforts between CNCF and OpenSSF.
<p>
I believe my broad understanding of OpenSSF TIs, and their goals along with the perspective I have as a hands on keyboard engineer I think make me a good fit as the SCIR.

   <td>I'm an active participant in the LF and in software supply chain security.  I am a creator of the CNCF graduated project TUF and the incubating project in-toto.  I am also a creator of the JDF and IEEE/ISTO standardized project Uptane, which deals with securing updates for automobiles.  I am a creator of two OpenSSF sandbox projects, gittuf and SBOMit as well.  My dissertation work was in designing the first package manager for the cloud and led to improvements in YaST, YUM, Apt, and PACMAN.  I am also a Tech Lead in CNCF's TAG Security, where I facilitate security assessments for CNCF projects.
<p>
Right now, all but 2 board members are from industry (and one is the SCIR seat which I am applying for).  I am motivated to be a vendor neutral voice and to also try to increase academic ties with the OpenSSF.  I feel like this will add an more diverse perspectives and increase impact.
