   <td>I have been heavily involved in OpenSSF for the several few years. I started off contributing on behalf of an end user and now have co-founded a startup that is also heavily involved in the OpenSSF. I am a SLSA steering committee member and maintainer. I am co-creator and maintainer of GUAC, an incubating project. I am currently a TAC member and sponsor of various projects. I am heavily involved in the Baseline initiative as a co-lead. I am a regular attendee of multiple other working groups. I have also done a lot of work to push OpenSSF supply chain security initiatives through the work of the Supply Chain Integrity Working Group and regularly speaking at conferences like Open Source Summit, Kubecon, and OpenSSF/SOSS day. I am also a CNCF TAG Security lead and help out with collaborative efforts between CNCF and OpenSSF.
<p>
I believe my understanding of both the hands on keyboard engineering along with the organizational and communications skills along with my perspective as a startup co-founder and previous experience in the end user space help qualify me to be a TAC member.

   <td>The highlight of last year for me was co-publishing "Principles for Package Repository Security" with US CISA, in my role as co-chair of the Securing Package Repositories Working Group. This document has influenced roadmaps and been directly cited by security RFCs in the NuGet and Crates ecosystems. It's a great example of what the open source community can do when it comes together, and how to productively engage the public sector, both of which I want to help the OpenSSF do more of by continuing to serve on the TAC. I've also been active in the Sigstore project, where we've seen how quickly a new security capability can be adopted when it makes maintainers lives easier; in the case of Sigstore, making it easy to sign and verify content without having to manage long-lived keys. 
<p>
This is another theme I want to spread throughout the OpenSSF next year: instead of asking maintainers to do more, ensuring our work makes maintainer's lives easier in addition to being more secure.

   <td>I have served on the OpenSSF TAC for the past three years (one as chair) and have worked with my colleagues on the TAC & governing board to execute our project governance process and refined the technical vision of the foundation. We have made significant progress in 2024 in evolving the identity of the OpenSSF, adding a number of new technical initiatives and helped to guide the community to address the wide landscape of problems present in this space. I am nominating myself in this election as I hope to continue to support the critical work of the OpenSSF in addressing current and future threats to the broader OSS ecosystem.
<p>
For over a decade, I have been involved in various open source communities in professional roles focused on upstream development, partner strategy and ecosystem engagement. I currently lead Google’s Open Source Security Team, where we directly contribute to a number of OpenSSF projects (SLSA, Sigstore, Package Analysis, OSV Schema, GUAC, OSV-Schema, Scorecard, Allstar) and drive communication & adoption of secure software supply chain best practices. I also am a founding member of the Sigstore TSC where we have built an exploding community of vendors, individuals and users focused on improving transparency of the supply chain and dramatically improving the UX for consumers and producers of OSS software.
<p>
As part of the OpenSSF TAC, I would continue to bring a breadth of experience and industry & academic connections to bear to help accelerate the impact of the various working groups. I am eager to support the OpenSSF's continued growth as both a forum for evangelizing best practices and as an sponsoring organization for projects that are laser-focused on helping OSS communities and users improve their security posture.

   <td>I bring extensive experience in open source and open standards organizations, with a strong focus on user needs, tangible benefits, and good governance practices. I have a track record of driving results in my work with W3C (where I co-chair the Technical Architecture Group) and other organizations. As a US/UK dual national based in London, and a member of the UK Government’s Open Standards Board, I also offer international and  technology policy experience. I have also been an advocate for vendor neutrality, for driving our work program based on developer needs and public good and for prioritizing diversity, inclusion, and transparency in all our work.
   <p>
   Since joining the OpenSSF TAC, I have consistently contributed to advancing its mission. I have also co-chaired the SCM guidelines work in Best Practices and I have contributed to the SBOM naming conventions in “SBOM everywhere”. This year I’ve had the great privilege to participate in the table top exercise panel at SOSS Community Day Europe, and  the SOSS Policy Summit Europe. I have also worked to connect the OpenSSF with other ecosystem organizations. Last year, I co-chaired a joint workshop with W3C, OWASP, and OpenJS Foundation on web developer security (“Secure the Web Forward”) and this year I’ve followed that up by chairing a W3C community group working on web application security guidelines which also brings together the wider community.
   <p>
   For the coming year, I look forward to strengthening our engagement with European policy initiatives and advancing software security collaboration across the ecosystem.

   I am a member of the OpenSSF technical community since 2022. During this time, I have actively participated in various TIs, committees and working groups, such as the Best Practices WG, the End Users WG, but also the Governance Committee and the Public Policy Committee.
   <p>
   Within the Best Practices WG, I have facilitated the creation of two SIGs: the C/C++ Compiler Options Hardening Guide and the Python Secure Coding Guide. Very recently, I accepted the role of co-chair of the Best Practices WG. Additionally, I contribute to the OpenSSF’s activities focusing on upcoming EU cyber regulation, for instance by participating in the CRA-focused TTX at SOSS Community Day EU.
   <p>
   Serving on the TAC and leveraging the experience gained through my involvement in the community, I’d like to work towards two goals: i) growing the technical community by strengthening our efforts to address the practical needs open source developers and project maintainers, and ii) fostering the development of methods and tools which help organizations to achieve compliance to upcoming cyber security regulation.

  My name is Michael Scovetta, and I would be honored to join the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). With over 20 years of experience in software security—10 of which have been dedicated to open source—I bring a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective to one of the most critical challenges we face today.
  <p>
  Open source software is the bedrock of modern society, and we owe a debt of gratitude to the maintainers and contributors who pour their heart and soul into the software we use every day. The OpenSSF has been a driving force for good through advocacy, alignment, and tooling—and we can do even more.
  <p>
  As a proud co-founder and co-lead of the Alpha-Omega project, I've seen firsthand how the right people in the right roles can drive substantial improvements quickly and visibly. I will bring to the TAC the same bias for action and conviction—that together we can solve these challenges. In addition to Alpha-Omega, I’ve participated in multiple working groups, led the Metrics & Metadata WG, authored the Threats, Risks and Mitigations white paper, and drove the creation of the security-reviews project. I regularly participate in Slack and other OpenSSF forums.
  <p>
  As a TAC representative, I would focus my energy on two key areas: (a) increasing community participation within OpenSSF, as they are the lifeblood of our organization; and (b) empowering and inspiring those participants to take on the world-changing problems we face. I ask for the opportunity to change the world.

 I wish to nominate myself to the Technical Advisory Council so I may further contribute to the technical mission of the OpenSSF and bring a perspective that combines my years of software engineering, outreach, and community experience.
 <p>
 As a prior maintainer of and contributor to enterprise open source projects, I understand firsthand the challenges of building and maintaining secure software at scale. My primary goals are to strengthen collaboration between open source developers and community security initiatives, help drive practical guidance for the critically overburdened maintainer community, and create more opportunities for new voices and perspectives in our technical discussions.

  I want to serve on the TAC to help bridge the gap between open source and enterprise, and continuously improve the security of open source software. I am a programmer at IBM and my experience across open source and open standards as a leader, contributor, maintainer, and technical committee member, would uniquely position me on the TAC to represent a constituency and perspective that is perhaps currently underrepresented, yet crucial to the mission of the OpenSSF.
  <p>
   I am an active contributor to OpenSSF Working Groups such as the Vulnerability Disclosures WG and the Best Practices WG, where I have helped to create and improve resources. Additionally, I am a contributor at the OpenJS Foundation's Security WG and serve as a voting member of its Cross Project Council. I co-chair TC39, the standards body for JavaScript, as well as its Security Task Group, TG3. I am also a delegate at TC54, the standards body for CycloneDX, and a member of the Express Technical Committee and its Security team.
   <p>
   I am passionate about supporting and elevating the work of contributors while fostering collaboration between open-source and enterprise stakeholders, especially when their goals are not always aligned. I have helped to coordinate, remediate, review, and disclose security vulnerabilities, and to mentor others on secure programming and vulnerability management, from both maintainer and consumer perspectives, in both open source and enterprise.
