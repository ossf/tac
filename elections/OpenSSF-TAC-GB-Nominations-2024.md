   <td>Intel nominates Christopher "CRob" Robinson as a GB-appointed TAC member.  CRob has been involved with the foundation since just after its inception and has been a strong community member and participant ever since.  CRob leads multiple Technical Initiatives (BEST WG, Vuln Disclosure WG, Security Toolbelt, EDU.SIG) and participates in the End User WG, Governance Committee, DevRel Committee, and Public Policy Committee.  For the last two years CRob has served on the TAC, and in 2023 voted by his peers to serve as the TAC's Chairperson and liaison with the Governing Board.  We feel CRob sets an excellent role-model for community engagement and participation that we would like to see continued in 2024 and beyond.

   <td>I would like to serve as the GB appointed TAC member to contribute technical leadership to OSS security objectives. My current engagement with OpenSSF has primarily leveraged my business experience. I have participated as a Governing Board observer seeking to accelerate Technical Initiatives through strategic governance and operations. Accomplishing this goal required partnership with the TAC and gave me a deep appreciation for the technical leadership they provide. Appointing me to a TAC leadership role more specifically allows the OpenSSF to leverage my technical expertise.
<p>
I bring diverse technical and security experience to the TAC. In my current role at Dell, I perform cybersecurity innovation research for the global CTO R&D organization. I have also been an enterprise security architect for Dell’s internal security team and have held roles in Identity and Access Management and IT at Wells Fargo and the US Air Force. Balancing these experiences in large enterprises, I have also worked in regional companies with small IT teams to create security partnerships with individual software developers.
<p>
As a GB appointed TAC member, I will collaboratively apply both my technical security and business strategy leadership with other TAC members to accelerate technical OSS security outcomes.

   <td>Zach has been an extremely engaged member of the TAC since being nominated to serve there several months ago. He's deeply committed to this problem space and wants to continue to serve. He's also demonstrated a broad ability to interact with peers across the ecosystem to drive change in a way that brings others along. I've included his statement from his application to be on the ballot for another term on the TAC.

"The OpenSSF continues to drive forward the security of the open source ecosystem, but there’s plenty of work left to do. The TAC needs to continue to make the Technical Initiative (TI) process more clear and straightforward, something I experienced first-hand in helping the AI/ML Working Group (WG) get accepted at the Sandbox stage. Over the past months, I revised the Special Interest Group lifecycle process to make it more clear and straightforward, as well participated in the Operating Model Committee to standardize the lifecycle process across all TIs. In terms of concrete security capabilities, as a co-chair of the Securing Software Repositories WG I authored “Build Provenance for All Package Registries” describing how we integrated build provenance with npm and how other registries could do the same. Soon after, the WG published a proposal “Build Provenance and Code-signing for Homebrew”, which was subsequently funded by Alpha Omega and is in the process of being implemented. The WG also adopted the Repository Service for TUF project which is helping RubyGems protect its package index from malicious tampering. I’m also an active contributor to the Sigstore project.
In short, I want to serve another term on the OpenSSF TAC to continue making our organization easier to understand and work with, to ensure our proposed security capabilities are easy to use with minimal burden on maintainers and consumers, and to ensure these capabilities deliver meaningful security impact in the next year."

   <td>I have served on the OpenSSF TAC for the past two years (one as chair) and have worked with my colleagues on the TAC & governing board to adopt a project governance process and refined the technical vision of the foundation. We have made significant progress in 2022-2023 in evolving the identity of the OpenSSF and helped to guide the community to address the wide landscape of problems present in this space. I am nominating myself in this election as I hope to continue to support the critical work of the OpenSSF in addressing current and future threats to the broader OSS ecosystem.
<p>
For over a decade, I have been involved in various open source communities in professional
<p>
roles focused on upstream development, partner strategy and ecosystem engagement. I
<p>
currently lead part of Google’s Open Source Security Team, where we directly contribute to
<p>
critical projects and drive communication & adoption of secure software supply chain best
<p>
practices. I also am a founding member of the Sigstore TSC where we have built an exploding community of vendors, individuals and users focused on improving transparency of the supply chain and dramatically improving the UX for consumers and producers of OSS software.
<p>
As part of the OpenSSF TAC, I would continue to bring a breadth of experience and industry & academic connections to bear to help accelerate the impact of the various working groups. I am eager to support the OpenSSF's continued growth as both a forum for evangelizing best practices and as an sponsoring organization for projects that are laser-focused on helping OSS communities and users improve their security posture.

   <td>Marcela is lead software supply chain researcher at Intel Labs. She draw on enterprise, open-source and academic collaborations to understand unique challenges, develop practical solutions and anticipate salient future problems. Serving on the OpenSSF TAC would allow her to support such cross-sector collaborations with an emphasis on holistic solutions. 
 <p>
Her main contributions to OpenSSF have been through the SCI WG. Since 2020, she has helped develop and promote the SLSA framework as a SIG member and OpenSSF Tech Talk panelist. She also co-led a new SLSA workstream enabling trusted hardware for enhanced build integrity. As a core maintainer for the CNCF in-toto project on supply chain attestation, she brought insights and connections from other areas of OSS. She will work on  opportunities for fostering closer collaboration with CNCF communities via the OpenSSF TAC. As Governing Board chair of both CNCF and OpenSSF, I'll work closely with her to make this a reality.
 <p>
She is eager to contribute to newer OpenSSF initiatives in 2024. The holistic best practices of the Security Toolbelt strongly align with my research approach. The DEI WG’s work to create a community in which underrepresented folks feel empowered to contribute their ideas is vital. Understanding the impact of emerging areas like GenAI on OSS security and developing suitable solutions are interesting challenges for the AI/ML Security WG. 
 <p>
While these initiatives each cover very distinct topics, she believes they are all crucial for achieving long-term OSS security. Driving work that ensures all sectors are ready to tackle the big supply chain problems of today and tomorrow is why she seeks to join the OpenSSF TAC.
