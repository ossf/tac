|Carlos Tadeu Panato Junior| Prounouns: He/Him Company: Chainguard [GitHub](https://github.com/cpanato) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpanato/)|I am deeply committed to advancing open source security through active technical contributions, primarily within the Sigstore and Scorecard projects. My work on Sigstore has focused on making software supply chain security accessible and practical for all developers, contributing to a project that has fundamentally changed how we approach code signing and verification in the open source ecosystem. Through my contributions to Scorecard, I've helped organizations assess and improve their security postures by providing actionable insights into repository security practices. This work directly addresses one of the most critical challenges in open source: making security best practices measurable and achievable. I want to amplify the voices of individual contributors who are driving OpenSSF's technical initiatives forward. My hands-on experience with these projects has given me insight into both the challenges contributors face and the opportunities for broader community engagement. I understand the importance of balancing technical excellence with practical adoption, and I've seen firsthand how the right tools and standards can transform security practices across the ecosystem. I believe the Security Community needs representation from those actively building the solutions we advocate for. My continued technical involvement ensures I remain grounded in the real-world challenges and innovations happening across OpenSSF projects. I'm committed to fostering collaboration, supporting emerging contributors, and ensuring that individual voices shape the strategic direction of open source security. I'm ready to serve and advocate for our community's technical contributors.|
|Carol Nichols| Pronouns: She/Her Company: Rust Foundation[GitHub](https://github.com/carols10cents) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolnichols/)|I have experience representing maintainers as a Project Director on the Rust Foundation board of directors. I'm a maintainer of crates.io, the Rust package registry, and I have provided feedback on the Principles for Package Repository Security. I would love to bring a maintainer perspective to the Governing Board. Open Source Software is the best way I know of to develop quality building blocks for industry and end-users. I want to be a part of figuring out how to have industry contribute in ways to sustain and secure open source development that doesn't unduly burden volunteers.|
|Adolfo García Veytia| Pronouns: He/Him Company: Carabiner Systems [GitHub](https://github.com/puerco) [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/puerco)|As the lead of several Technical Initiatives within the OpenSSF and as an active contributor helping improve and deploy various OpenSSF projects, I would focus on two main areas if elected as the SCIR: 1. Driving adoption at scale: Working with the Governing Board to identify and propose solutions to close gaps that hinder project adoption, particularly in large open-source ecosystems. 2. Ensuring ecosystem cohesion: Raising to the GB’s attention compatibility issues between Technical Initiatives that prevent our projects from functioning as a unified ecosystem. Much of my work this year has centered on making our projects protect and reinforce one another: Sigstore-signing SLSA releases, using SLSA attestations to meet Baseline requirements, instrumenting Baseline compliance in OpenVEX, and using VEX data to manage vulnerabilities in Protobom, among others. This circular interdependence has tested the usability of our projects, their user experience and interoperability in real-world scenarios, revealing where the rough edges are. As an active maintainer, I aim to surface these issues to the GB and, from the SCIR seat, advocate for better coordination to improve adoption and interoperability across the OpenSSF landscape.|
