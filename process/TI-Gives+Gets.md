# "Gives and Gets" for OpenSSF Technical Initiatives (TI)
_v1.0 approved and merged by the TAC on December 11, 2023_

The OpenSSF has a large community of contributors and efforts that span the broad spectrum of open source security interests.  The Technical Initiatives (TIs) of the foundation are where community members collaborate and help craft unique solutions to address improving the security of the open source ecosystem.
In exchange for meeting certain requirements, the TIs are eligible to receive an assortment of benefits and have access to the capabilities of the Foundation's resources.  The specific requirements and benefits (aka "Gives and Gets") for each level of maturity are documented below. Note that this about the maturity of the TI itself - basically about how it operates - rather than of its product. A TI can be at an advanced level of maturity even though its product is still immature and vice versa.

Based on the specific type of work the TI is focused on (e.g., software, specification, or documentation development) the requirements and benefits may slightly differ as applicable.

Also note that benefits may actually vary based on resources and funds availability, or lack thereof.

## Sandbox level Gives & Gets

### Gives/Requirements

 * TI must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas or address an unfulfilled need. It is expected that the initial code needed for an OpenSSF WG to work be kept within their repository and will not function as a project in its own right. Should initial WG code grow and mature that it warrants its own Project status, then it is subject to Sandbox entry requirements. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
 * TI must maintain a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project).  TI must have a minimum of three contributors with a minimum of two different organization affiliations.
 * WG must find a TAC sponsor that can help guide the WG through its sandbox stage.
 * Project and SIG must find an aligned WG to host the TI or must have a TAC sponsor that can help guide the TI through the sandbox stage.
 * TI agrees to follow the [Secure Software Development Guiding Principles](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/SecureSoftwareGuidingPrinciples.md) and the [Open Source Consumption Manifesto](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/tree/main/MANIFESTO).
 * If contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).
 * Provides quarterly updates to the TAC on technical vision and progress on vision.
 * TI will have a [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ossf/project-template/blob/main/SECURITY.md) that describes how the Project manages vulnerabilities, or more broadly how the OSSF handles vulnerability reports.

### Gets/Benefits

 * TI can get assistance with Architecture & Roadmap Alignment.
 * Receives consideration as in-scope for any submission to an OpenSSF-managed conference or event.
 * TI receives guidance on technical direction from its TAC sponsor or hosting WG.
 * Reserved space for project updates in OpenSSF newsletters.
 * May request basic infrastructure support from the OpenSSF (e.g., mailing list and github repo).
 * Projects may say they are, "A sandbox project in the OpenSSF" or "An experimental project in the OpenSSF."  
 * Gets a ["sandbox" badge](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/files/images/OpenSSF_StagesBadges_sandbox.svg) that is shared amongst all OpenSSF sandbox TIs.
 * Communication & Collaboration - OpenSSF mailing list, OpenSSF Slack channel, OpenSSF GitHub, OpenSSF Calendaring / Recording,  OpenSSF Social Media & External Engagement Support
 * Governance & Administration - TI Charter Development & Review, TI Technical Steering Committee Setup, TI IP & License Review, TI Operations & Maintenance, Technical Support
* Best effort OpenSSF staff support

## Incubating level Gives & Gets

### Gives/Requirements

All requirements of Sandbox must be fulfilled. PR filed to promote TI to Incubating stage.
 * TI must have documented, initial group governance.
 * Maintains a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project) with an active flow of contributions, and documents the current list of maintainers:
   * WG must have a minimum of five participants with a minimum of three different organization affiliations.
   * Project and SIG must have a minimum of three contributors with a minimum of two different organization affiliations.
 * WG and Project has met at least 5 times within the last calendar quarter since becoming Sandbox.
 * SIG must have made substantial progress on a deliverable.
 * Project must have defined a contributor guide, which makes it clear how and when contributors should be given increasing responsibilities towards maintainership of the project. (Example guides: Sigstore, AllStar)
 * Project should be able to show adoption by multiple parties and adoption's value to the open source community and/or end users (may include adoption of beta/early versions) with the intent to showcase wide adoption by the project's consumers.
 * TI that develops code:
   * Implements, practices, and refines mature software development and release practices such as following a version schema.
   * Follows security best practices (as recommended by the OpenSSF and others), including passing the OpenSSF Best Practices criteria, secret scanning, and code scanning.
   * Maintains a point of contact for vulnerability reports in the security.md.
   * Must use Scorecards.
 * Begins to establish the appropriate governance that enables its sustainment for potential graduation.

### Gets/Benefits

 TI eligible to receive all Gets from Sandbox plus:
 * Receives more infrastructure support from the OpenSSF (e.g., website support)
 * Receives consideration as in-scope for any submission to an OpenSSF-managed conference or event.
 * Project may request custom OpenSSF Logo for group
 * May request swag bearing custom OpenSSF Logo
 * Projects may use the OpenSSF logo to promote their project (in accordance with the trademark guidelines). Projects may not be referred to as an "OpenSSF Project" or "OpenSSF $ProjectName." Projects may say they are an "OpenSSF Incubating Project."
 * Gets an ["incubating" badge](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/files/images/OpenSSF_StagesBadges_incubating.svg) that is shared amongst all OpenSSF incubating TIs.
 * With additional TAC or WG approval, may fundraise for dedicated project funds, coordinated by the OpenSSF.
 * Receives support with vulnerability disclosure from the OpenSSF (Vulnerability Disclosure WG).
 * May post project updates and tutorials to the OpenSSF blog.
 * Recieves higer priority for OpenSSF staff support than Incubating, less than Graduated.
