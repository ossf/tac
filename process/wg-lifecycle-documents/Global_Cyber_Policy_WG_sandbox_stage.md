## Application for creating a new Working Group at Sandbox stage

Global Cyber Policy Working Group

### List of interested individuals
The WG must have a minimum of 3 interested contributors from two different organizations.
  * Arnaud Le Hors, IBM, [lehors](https://github.com/lehors)
  * CRob, OpenSSF-LF, [SecurityCRob](https://github.com/SecurityCRob)
  * Daniel Appelquist, Samsung, [Torgo](https://github.com/Torgo)
  * Georg Kunz, Ericsson, [gkunz](https://github.com/gkunz)
  * Christian "fukami" Horchert, OpenSSF-LF, [ ]( )
  * Mirko Boehm, LF-Europe, [ ]( )
  * Mike Bursell, CCC, [ ]( )


### Mission of the Working Group
The WG must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and address an unfulfilled need. It is preferred that topics falling with the scope of existing OpenSSF WGs are addressed within the existing wG rather than seek a new WG.
  * To provide a forum for our members and the broader community to collaborate on Global Cybersecurity-related legislation, frameworks, and standards, this group will begin with a focus on the EU's CRA legislation, but in the future can expand into other related topics.
  * The First three SIGs that will be created will be:
  1.) CRA-Awareness - focused on educational and training materials, research and events that help educate Manufacturers, Stewards, and open source maintainers on obligations, artifacts, and processes they must have in place to comply with the CRA.
  2.) CRA-Community Standards - focused on converting applicable community specifications into internationally-recognized standards.
  3.) CRA-Format, Tooling & Process - focused on data formats, tooling and processes that must be put into place to help Linux Foundation projects be compliant with the CRA.

### IP policy and licensing due diligence
When contributing to OpenSSF any existing material for the new WG to work on, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).
  * At this time, no new IP/licenses will be transfered to the Linux Foundation.  At such time that software or specs are considered to be donated, they will perform the standard LF IP/license review.
  * All work products of these groups will be covered under a valid open source license, such as Apache 2.0, Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution International License CC-BY-4.0, or Community Specificiation 1.0
  
### TAC Sponsor
TAC sponsor agrees to attend WG meetings regularly, although they are not required to have a formal role in WG.
  * Daniel Appelquist, Samsung, [Torgo](https://github.com/Torgo)

  
### Working Group References
The WG should provide a list of existing resources with links to the repository, and if available, website and any other material to showcase the existing breadth, maturity, and direction of the WG.
