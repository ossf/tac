## Mission of the Working Group

> [!NOTE]
> The WG must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and address an unfulfilled need. It is preferred that topics falling with the scope of existing OpenSSF WGs are addressed within the existing wG rather than seek a new WG.

The WG exists to develop and maintain interoperable resources related to the identification and presentation of security-relevant data.

Recognizing the generous support provided to-date by their respecive homes, but moving forward to centralize these tightly-coupled activities, the WG at launch will take responsibility for the following OpenSSF projects and repositories:

- [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline)
- [Open Source Project Security Assessments](https://github.com/ossf/security-assessments)
- [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec)
- [SI Tooling](https://github.com/ossf/si-tooling)

Following formation and initial stabilization, the WG will additionally seek to facilitate contribution to OpenSSF of additional resources which have streamlined development and/or adoption of the aforementioned resources. This includes logical models, schemas, libraries, and control validation/enforcement tooling.

## IP policy and licensing due diligence

> [!NOTE]
> When contributing to OpenSSF any existing material for the new WG to work on, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).

- At this time, no new IP/licenses will be transfered to the Linux Foundation.  At such time that software or specs are considered to be donated, they will perform the standard LF IP/license review.
- All work products of these groups will be covered under a valid open source license, such as Apache 2.0, Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution International License CC-BY-4.0, or Community Specificiation 1.0

## TAC Sponsor

> [!NOTE]
> TAC sponsor agrees to attend WG meetings regularly, although they are not required to have a formal role in WG.
