# Project Life Cycle

Projects are either directly under the governance of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) or a specific Working Group (WG). In all cases, the TAC is responsible for reviewing and approving all significant changes to a Project's life cycle. Where a Project reports into a specific WG, that WG can support the Project's progression and provide recommendations to the TAC.

Projects follow the sandbox, incubating, graduated and archival lifecycle stagesdefined below.

The lifecycle progression, movement from one stage to another, allows them to participate at the level that is most appropriate for them given where they are at, and signals to our community and those outside what level of maturity and continuity can be expected from a Project.

## Stages - Definitions & Expectations

Projects have a maturity level of sandbox, incubating, or graduated. Archived is for Projects no longer in active development. The maturity level is a signal by OpenSSF as to what sorts of enterprises should be adopting different projects. Projects increase their maturity by demonstrating their sustainability to OpenSSF’s Technical Advisory Committee(TAC): that they have adoption, a healthy rate of changes, committers from multiple organizations, have adopted the OpenSSF Code of Conduct, and have achieved and maintained the Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge.

### Sandbox

The OpenSSF Sandbox is the entry point for early stage Projects and has four goals:

* Encourage public visibility of experiments or other early work that can add value to the OpenSSF mission and build the ingredients of a successful Incubation level Project
* Facilitate alignment with existing Working Groups or Projects if (and only if) this is desired
* Nurture Projects (e.g. via OpenSSF Service Desk requests)
* Remove possible legal and governance obstacles to adoption and contribution by ensuring all projects adhere to OpenSSF legal, code of conduct, and IP Policy requirements.

#### Sandbox Entry Requirements

Projects being submitted to the OpenSSF at the sandbox level are intended to be the entry point for early stage projects and are not required to undergo due diligence.

Sandbox Projects should be early-stage projects that the OpenSSF TAC or parent Working Group believes warrant experimentation.

* New Projects that are designed to extend one or more OpenSSF Projects with functionality or interoperability libraries.
* Independent projects that fit the OpenSSF mission and provide potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need)
* Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the OpenSSF, including initial code for OpenSSF WG collaborations, and "experimental" projects
* Any project that realistically intends to join OpenSSF Incubation in future and wishes to lay the foundations for that

#### Project Graduation Process: Sandbox to Incubating

Incubating Projects are required to undergo due diligence as a part of the process to move from Sandbox to Incubation. Due Diligence is driven by a TAC or parent WG sponsor. Once the diligence is complete and the proposal made, two weeks are allocated for public comment before a TAC vote is called.

### Incubating

#### Incubating Entry Requirements

To be accepted to incubating stage, a project must meet the sandbox stage requirements plus:

* Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent adopters which, in the TAC’s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.
* Have a healthy number of maintainers. A maintainer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept and merge contributions to some or all of the project.
* Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions.
* Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TAC has final judgement over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria
* A clear versioning scheme.
* Specifications must have at least one public reference implementation.

#### Project Graduation Process: Incubating to Graduation

Projects that wish to move from Incubating to Graduation should open a PR confirming the following criteria:
* Have maintainers from at least two organizations.
* Have achieved and maintained an [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/).
* Have completed an independent and third party security audit with results published of similar scope and quality as [this example](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy#security-audit) which includes all critical vulnerabilities and all critical vulnerabilities need to be addressed before graduation. The TAC, or another WG, may provide assistance in acquiring such an audit.
* Explicitly define project governance and process to be granted maintainership within the project team. This is preferably laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus maintainers.
* Have a public list of project adopters for at least the primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the project website). For a specification, have a list of adopters for the implementation(s) of the spec.
* Please include a short one-page narrative based off the Graduation template, no more than 500 words.

### Graduated

Graduated projects signal the highest level of maturity for an OpenSSF project.

#### Project Graduation Process: Graduated to Archiving

Open source projects have a lifecycle and there are times that projects become inactive due to a variety of reasons. There are also cases where a project may no longer want to be supported by the TAC, or the TAC may no longer wish to recommend the use of a project.

#### Archiving Criteria

When voting on a proposal to archive a project, TAC members may wish to consider whether the project continues to meet the criteria for OpenSSF acceptance. The TAC may also look at activity levels in the project (https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health-table?orgId=1), although it is important to note that there is a difference between a mature project that doesn't get much attention any more but is stable, versus a project that is inactive.

#### Submission Forms for Graduated to Archived

1. [Proposal](TBD)
2. [Legal](TBD)

### Archived

Archived projects are no longer in active development and are only archived after a TAC or parent WG vote.

What does archiving for an OpenSSF project mean?
* OpenSSF will no longer provide support for the project via service desk
* OpenSSF will list archived projects online
* Trademarks and domain names of archived projects are still hosted by the OpenSSF and the Linux Foundation
* OpenSSF can provide services such as documentation updates to help transition users.
* Other OpenSSF marketing activities will no longer be provided for the project

To archive a project:
* A proposal must be put forth to the TAC or WG repo
* The TAC or parent WG will inform the project maintainers, OpenSSF end user community and wider community of all archiving proposals
* The proposal must remain open for at least 2 weeks of discussion after the maintainers are informed.
* A vote must be finalized with 2/3 approval from the TAC or parent WG.
