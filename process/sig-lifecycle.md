# Special Interest Group (SIG) Life Cycle

Special Interest Groups are under the direct governance of their reporting Working Group (WG) and are bound to achieving a very specific goal. These groups may be terminated upon completion of their designating tasking, continued for larger and ongoing efforts, or otherwise subject to the governance, structure, and termination policies of the WG they are under. The creation of a SIG must dictate the focus, intent, goals, and deliverables as appropriate.

It is expected that the primary output of a SIG is not software. If the primary output is software, the work should be organized as a [project](./project-lifecycle.md).

SIG process should be minimal with as much as possible delegated to the WG. However we do need minimal process to at least ensure we have an accurate list of all the active SIGs in the OpenSSF. This document uses "must" to describe what items are required and "should" to suggest items that should be strongly considered (but not required).

## To become `Tentative`:

* This is the default state of a new SIG that is not yet active

## To become `Active`:

* A SIG must have a repository (prefixed with `sig-`) that includes the current state of the SIG, lists the chairs of the SIG, and a statement of the focus, intent, goals, and/or deliverables of the group
* The chairs of a WG must agree to govern the SIG
  * The chairs of the WG should have its membership vote, with notice given at the meeting prior to the vote
* The governing WG must list the active SIGs it governs, along with chairs and links to the repository of those SGs
  * The governing WG should list previous SIGs that are now inactive
* SIGs should have regular meetings
  * If these meetings are separate from their governing WG:
    * They should appear on the OpenSSF calendar
    * They should have a document with upcoming agendas and notes from past meetings

## To become `Inactive`:

* The chairs of a SIG can decide to become inactive, in which case they must update their state in their repository and notify their governing WG
* The chairs of the governing WG must periodically review their active SIGs and determine if any should become inactive
  * This review should happen at least annually
  * The chairs of the WG should have its membership vote, with notice given at the meeting prior to the vote
