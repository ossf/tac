This process details how an eligible OpenSSF Technical Initiative can petition for resources and funding.

## Pre-conditions ##
    - The TI must have an identified lifecycle phase inside the OpenSSF, such as sandbox, incubating, or graduated. 
    - The TI requesters should know: 
          - Within general funding limits for the TIs at the respective lifecycle, that are to be determined. 

## Workflow ##  
  1. TI or TIs working together see a need for funding some work that doesn’t exist within an existing give/get that is pre-approved. For example cloud credits to do a PoC or case study.
  2. TI(s) get consensus on the scope of how much money they are asking for and to be spent on what. For example $10k-$15k in cloud credits over a year to spend on building out a PoC to test out <some set of things>
  3. TI(s) drafts that includes:
     - Problem Statement in the form below
     - Proposed work and other work considered
     - Benefit to OSSF and ecosystem
     - Approximate cost
     - If a third party (like a cloud provider) is requested, please list any vendor preferences (Note, these are not guaranteed and if the request is approved, you will work with OpenSSF Staff to finalize vendors to reach alignment where possible).
  4. TI submits this issue to the TAC. This will be treated like a CFP. Respondents will be notified in writing, and approved proposals will be published.
  5.  Submitted funding requests will be reviewed at least quarterly, relative to each other. Dates where proposals can be accepted, as well as when the review cycle will occur, and when decisions will be made. The TAC reserves a weeklong window for technical merit, and the finance review will occur the following week.
  6.  TAC evaluates the technical merit of the proposal and checks that its goals within OSSF and ecosystem seem reasonable and achievable. (See TAC evaluation below). During the two week review period, TAC and OpenSSF staff may iterate with TI(s) on the proposal with any questions needed to make the technical merit and funding approval decision.
  7. TAC brings approved proposals to the funding workflow (see below).
  8. The OpenSSF General Manager or delegate will review any proposals with TAC technical merit (see Finance evaluation below) and determine which proposals will be funded based on the availability of funds. OpenSSF staff will distribute funds. Note: If the funding request is beyond the authorized financial delegation for the General Manager, the Budget and Finance Committee and/or OpenSSF board may have to approve.
  9. TAC/OpenSSF General Manager or delegate will review funding initiative status on milestones. If a funding initiative has more than one milestone, funds may be dispersed after each milestone is achieved (funding initiatives asking for more funds should most likely have more milestones for fund releasing). If the milestone is reached, the TAC/OpenSSF General Manager or delegate agree that Staff should disperse funds for additional milestones(s).

## TAC Review ##
  - Is this request in line with the [TAC Technical Vision](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/technical-vision.md)?
  - Is this request in line with the OpenSSF [MVS](https://openssf.org/about/), and soon to be [finalized R](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UoQudHQuaXNzakhOYbAS3IceI9TkSSR6N0bgm1fTTK0/edit#heading=h.493lq0mo4y4f)? (this is how GB/GC communicate “top-down” initiatives, like the SOSS Task Force).
  - Does the requester(s) have an accepted [TI lifecycle phase](https://github.com/ossf/tac/tree/main/process) in good standing?
      - Within general funding limits for the TIs at the respective lifecycle (e.g. Sandbox should generally ask for less than Incubating, which should ask for less than Graduated)
      - Within approved categories of asks (e.g. no asking for a TI outing at a fancy restaurant but yes to cloud credits)
      - What will be the milestone review requested and when?
   - Final decision is open discussion and a majority consensus vote.
   - TAC moves approved requests forward and recommends to the OpenSSF General Manager and the Governance Committee for dispensation.
