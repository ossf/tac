## Project incubation application

### List of project maintainers
The project must have a minimum of three maintainers with a minimum of two different organizational affiliations.
  * "name, affiliation, GitHub ID"

### Mission of the project
The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be code needed to deliver OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
  * "description of the project mission"

### Project adoption
The project should be able to show adoption by multiple parties and the adoption's value to the open source community and/or end users (may include adoption of beta/early versions).
  * "description of adoption"

### Governance
Projects must have documented, initial project governance
  * "link to governance documents"

### IP policy and licensing due diligence
When contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF). This step is only needed for the initial donation and only applicable here, if the project intends to join the OpenSSF Incubation stage.
  * "yes / no / not applicable. If yes, provide a link to the corresponding GitHub issue."

### Project References
The project should provide a list of existing resources with links to the repository, website, a roadmap, contributing guide, demos and walkthroughs, and any other material to showcase the existing breadth, maturity, and direction of the project.
