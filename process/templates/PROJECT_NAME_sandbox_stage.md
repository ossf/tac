## Application for creating a new project at sandbox stage

### List of project maintainers
The project must have a minimum of two maintainers with different company affiliations.

### Mission of the project
The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
  * "description of the project mission"

### IP policy and licensing due dilligence
If contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).
  * "yes / no / not applicable. If yes, provide a link to the corresponding GitHub issue."
