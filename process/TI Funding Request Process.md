This process details how an eligible OpenSSF Technical Initiative (TI) can apply for funding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review the "Qualifying for funding" section carefully

## Qualifying for funding

- This process is for existing OpenSSF TIs that have a [documented lifecycle phase](/process/Technical_Initiative_Lifecycle.md) (e.g. sandbox, incubating, or graduated)
  - If you are not an OpenSSF TI, you can make use of other funding source like [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/grants/how-to-apply/)
- Depending on the lifecycle phase of your TI, you may already qualify for things like a logo, stickers, or other swag; see [TI Gives and Gets](/process/TI-Gives%2BGets.md)
  - Contact OpenSSF staff about items in [TI Gives and Gets](/process/TI-Gives%2BGets.md); you do not need to follow this process

## Process to apply for funding

  1. Review "Qualifying for funding" section above.
  2. Applying TI should [fill out funding application](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/new?template=funding_application.yml)
  3. TAC will review funding applications with the criteria listed in "TAC review" section below according to the schedule listed in the "Review cycles" section below
  4. TAC notifies the OpenSSF General Manager (or delegate) to determine which proposals will be funded based on the availability of funds. Funding beyond the delegated authority of the OpenSSF General Manager will need approval of the Budget and Finance Committee, and/or Governing Board. OpenSSF Staff will distribute funds.
  5. TAC, OpenSSF General Manager, or delegate will review funding initiative status on milestones. If a funding initiative has more than one milestone, funds may be dispersed after each milestone is achieved (funding initiatives asking for more funds should most likely have more milestones for fund releasing). If the milestone is reached, the TAC, OpenSSF General Manager, or delegate agree that Staff should disperse funds for additional milestones(s).

## Example funding requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These examples may use previous processes; please review the "Process to apply for funding" section above for the current process

Here are some example funding requests that were approved, and we'd like to see more of in the future:

| TI | Lifecycle Stage (at the time) | Link | Amount | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEI WG | Incubating | [Outreachy intern for GUAC](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/265) | $8,000 | |
| RSTUF Project | Sandbox | [Cloud/k8s deployment costs for tests, demo and validations](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/315) | €1,000 | These cloud credits were specifically to pay for development costs; the OpenSSF governing board does not want to pay for ongoing hosting costs of services |
| Sigstore Project | Graduated | [Documentation Modernization](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/339) | $50,000 | |
| RSTUF Project | Incubation | [Security Audit for 1.0.0](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/379) | $44,000 | |
| Securing Repositories WG | Graduated | [Technical Writer for Package Yanking Guidance](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/414) | $4,000 | |

## TAC review
  - Is this request in line with the [TAC Technical Vision](/technical-vision.md)?
  - Is this request in line with the OpenSSF [Mission, Vision, Values, and Strategy](https://openssf.org/about/)?
  - Does the requester(s) have an accepted [TI lifecycle phase](/process) in good standing?
      - Does the requested amount align with the lifecycle stage the TI is at?
   - Final decision is open discussion and a majority consensus vote.
   - TAC moves approved requests forward and recommends to the OpenSSF General Manager and the Governance Committee for dispensation.
