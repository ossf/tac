# OpenSSF TAC Onboarding

Welcome to the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council. Thank you in advance for your dedication to the work this role will entail.

Per the [OpenSSF charter][charter] 5c:

> The role of the TAC is to structure and facilitate collaboration among the Technical Initiatives.
>
> The TAC will be responsible for:
>
> i. developing an overall technical vision for the community;
>
> ii. approving, establishing, structuring, organizing, and archiving Technical Initiatives;
>
> iii. creating, maintaining and amending the policies and procedures for Technical Initiative onboarding and communications with the TAC;
>
> iv. working with the Technical Initiatives to identify any resource or funding requirements and prioritizing recommendations to the Governing Board;
>
> v. facilitating crowdfunding opportunities in support of OpenSSF Technical Initiatives;
>
> vi. annually electing a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken, and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TAC's representative (the "TAC Representative"); and
>
> vii. coordinating such other technical community matters related to the success of Technical Initiatives and the mission of the OpenSSF

Please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the [charter][charter].

This onboarding document is designed to provide some introductory and ***non-exhaustive*** information to new TAC members.
As a TAC member, it is your responsibility to keep this document up to date.

By design, this onboarding document contains limited information to set expectations and provide a TAC member with generalities about the role and work we do. For specific instructions, guidance, templates, etc., please refer to the content in the [`/process` directory](./README.md).

It covers details on topics such as how we make decisions, technical initiative lifecycles, and the funding process.

## OpenSSF staff

Occasionally, you will need support from OpenSSF staff.

Here are the best ways to reach them:

- Slack: [#openssf-operations](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C05BETTLHEE), [#tac_members-openssf_staff](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C06D9AVUVD3) (private)
- Mailing list: [operations@openssf.org](mailto:operations@openssf.org)

## Bio

The community would love to know more about you!
Take some time to draft a short bio to be featured on the [TAC page](https://openssf.org/about/tac/) of the OpenSSF website.

When you're ready, submit the bio to [OpenSSF staff](#openssf-staff).

## Communication

The OpenSSF TAC uses a few different mediums to coordinate work and communicate with the wider OpenSSF community. There are private communication channels available if needed, but please default to public communication whenever possible, even for mundane day-to-day topics. This ensures the TAC is operating as transparently as possible for the OpenSSF community.

You should ensure you join or attain membership for each of them.

## GitHub

A great amount of OpenSSF TAC work is coordinated via issues and pull requests on GitHub. It allows us to work asynchronously between meetings.

### Access

As a TAC member, you will be added to the [`@ossf/tac`](https://github.com/orgs/ossf/teams/tac) GitHub team.

This team is:

- [automatically tagged for reviews](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) in the `ossf/tac` repository
- [authorized to vote](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/.gitvote.yml) in [GitVote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote)-triggered votes

If you are not a member of this team, please request access from an existing member or [OpenSSF staff](#openssf-staff).

### Notifications

Everyone has a different strategy for staying up-to-date with what's happening on GitHub. We won't prescribe any specific techniques, but we will make a few suggestions here that you can take into consideration.

#### Watching a repository

By default, you will receive notifications for conversations in which you are already participating or have been @mentioned.
By watching a repository (clicking the "Watch" button in the top-right corner), you will be notified of all conversations happening across the repository.

#### Configuring notifications

There are a few ways you may receive notifications for GitHub: email, notifications inbox, GitHub mobile app notifications

GitHub has a great resource for deciding which notification schemes may work for you and [how to configure them](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

## Meetings

### Prepping for your first meeting

The first TAC meeting of the year will very likely follow the same cadence as the previous year's meetings.

If you don't already have the TAC meetings on your calendar, please reach out to [OpenSSF staff](#openssf-staff).

The TAC Chair or Vice Chair will endeavor to send out an agenda by Friday the week before the meeting.

Here's what you can do to prepare for the meeting:

- get familiar with the Technical Initiatives that may be providing readouts
- review and comment on open issues and pull requests in the repository
- consider your candidacy for [TAC Chair or Vice Chair](#tac-chair-elections)

## TAC Chair elections

During the earlier part of the year the TAC holds an election to select a new Chair and Vice Chair.

The Chair sets the agenda and runs the TAC meetings, gives updates to the Governance Committee and Governing Board, and generally ensures the work of the TAC moves forward. The Vice Chair assists in these duties, particularly if the Chair is not available.

If you're interested in serving in this capacity, please let the TAC know ahead of the first meeting of the year.
