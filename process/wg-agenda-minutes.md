# OpenSSF Working Group Agenda and Minutes

Working group contributors are responsible for maintaining agendas and meeting minutes for their respective groups.

## Maintaining Agendas & Minutes
For each working group meeting, please follow the steps below:
1. Open the agenda or meeting notes document linked in [the community calendar](https://calendar.openssf.org/) invite found on the public OpenSSF calendar. 
2. Ensure the Document Outline view (left-hand side) is enabled.
3. Click “Template” at the bottom of the outline to jump to the correct template.
4. Copy all text for the appropriate meeting template.
5. Paste the template beneath the “Meetings” header, maintaining chronological order (especially important for documents with multiple meetings).
6. Update the date and meeting title to match the format used in previous entries.
7. Review the attendance section:
    - Remove rows not marked with an “x”
    - Confirm attendance aligns with actual participation as recorded in LFX

**Note:** Some agenda documents contain multiple templates because they include sub-project notes within the same working group document. 
Be sure to copy the template that corresponds to the specific meeting you are updating.

## Notify the Community
Once the agenda has been updated:

1. Post a message in the appropriate Slack channel letting the group know the agenda is ready.
2. Ask contributors to add discussion topics under “Open Items”.
