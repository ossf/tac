## Project Mission

FuzzingBrain is an autonomous Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically discover and patch software vulnerabilities. The project addresses a critical gap in the open source security ecosystem: the need for intelligent, automated vulnerability detection that can scale across diverse codebases.

### Key Capabilities

- **Autonomous Vulnerability Discovery**: Uses LLM-powered analysis combined with fuzzing techniques to identify security vulnerabilities in C and Java codebases
- **Automated Patch Generation**: Not only finds vulnerabilities but also generates patches to fix them
- **OSS-Fuzz Integration**: Designed to work with existing OSS-Fuzz infrastructure, enabling seamless integration with the broader fuzzing ecosystem
- **Multi-Language Support**: Currently supports C and Java, with architecture designed for extensibility
