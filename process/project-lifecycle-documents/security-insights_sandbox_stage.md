# Security Insights Sandbox Application

While Security Insights has been an OpenSSF project since 2022, a lifecycle document was never logged. This seeks to rectify that oversight.

## Application for creating a new project at Sandbox stage

### List of project maintainers

The project currently has 2 maintainers:

* Eddie Knight, Sonatype, @eddie-knight
* Jason Meridth, GitHub, @jmeridth

### Sponsor

Most projects will report to an existing OpenSSF Working Group, although in some cases a project may report directly to the TAC. The project commits to providing quarterly updates on progress to the group they report to.

* [ORBIT WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-orbit)

### Mission of the project

The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.

* Security Insights provides a mechanism for projects to report information about their security in a machine-processable way. It is formatted as a YAML file to make it easy to read and edit by humans. The data tracked within this specification is intended to fill the gaps between simplified solutions such as SECURITY.md and comprehensive automated solutions such as SBOMs. In that gap lay elements that must be self-reported by projects to allow end-users to make informed security decisions.

### Project References

The project should provide a list of existing resources with links to the repository, and if available, website, a roadmap, contributing guide, demos and walkthroughs, and any other material to showcase the existing breadth, maturity, and direction of the project.
