## Application for creating a new project at Sandbox stage

### List of project maintainers
The project must have a minimum of three maintainers with a minimum of two different organizational affiliations.
  * Bishnu Bista, TBD, @bishnubista
  * Frederick F. Kautz IV, Astha, @fkautz
  * Sarah Evans, Dell, @sevansdell

### Sponsor
Most projects will report to an existing OpenSSF Working Group, although in some cases a project may report directly to the TAC. The project commits to providing quarterly updates on progress to the group they report to.
  * AI/ML Security WG

### Mission of the project
The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
  * SAFE-Framework provides a shared security framework for Agentic AI systems, focusing on the real-world side effects of autonomous actions, tool use, and model-to-model interactions. It catalogs tactics and techniques for agentic failure modes and security abuse, and offers guidance for mitigation and detection so builders can assess and reduce risk before deployment.

### IP policy and licensing due diligence
When contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).
  * TBD (existing project; TAC issue link pending)

### Project References
The project should provide a list of existing resources with links to the repository, and if available, website, a roadmap, contributing guide, demos and walkthroughs, and any other material to showcase the existing breadth, maturity, and direction of the project.
